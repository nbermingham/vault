**Core Concepts:** [[Virtue]], [[Reason]], [[Nature]], [[Control]]  

## Overview  
Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy founded by **[[Zeno of Citium]]** in the early 3rd century BCE. It teaches that the path to a virtuous and fulfilling life lies in understanding nature, accepting what is within our control, and exercising reason to align our actions with universal principles.  

- **Key Figures:**  
  - [[Zeno of Citium]] (Founder)  
  - [[Marcus Aurelius]] (Roman Emperor, author of *[[Meditations by Marcus Aurelius]]*)  
  - [[Seneca]] (Roman statesman and Stoic writer)  
  - [[Epictetus]] (Former slave, Stoic teacher)

- **Historical Context:**  
  Stoicism originated in [[Athens]] and later gained prominence in [[Rome]]. It was influenced by earlier schools like **[[Cynicism]]** and **[[Heraclitean thought]]**.  

## Core Principles  
### 1. **[[Virtue as the Highest Good]]**  
   - Virtue (arete) is the sole measure of a good life.  
   - The four cardinal virtues:  
     - **[[Wisdom]]**: Knowing what is good, bad, or indifferent.  
     - **[[Courage]]**: Enduring pain or difficulty for the greater good.  
     - **[[Justice]]**: Treating others fairly and rightly.  
     - **[[Temperance]]**: Exercising self-control.

### 2. **[[Dichotomy of Control]]**  
   - Distinguish between what is within your control (actions, judgments) and what is not (external events).  
   - Focus only on what you can control; accept the rest as part of nature.  

### 3. **[[Living According to Nature]]**  
   - Align actions with the rational order of the universe.  
   - Human reason mirrors the [[Universal Reason (Logos)]]  

### 4. **[[Emotion]] and [[Reason]]**  
   - Emotions stem from judgments; change the judgment, and you change the emotion.  
   - Strive for [[apatheia]] (freedom from destructive emotions).  

## Practical Applications

- **[[Evening Reflection]]:** Review the day and consider how to improve.  
- **[[Negative Visualization]]:** Imagine potential hardships to prepare the mind for adversity.  
- **[[Focus on the Present Moment]]:** Avoid being disturbed by past regrets or future anxieties.
