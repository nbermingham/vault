**Arche** (ἀρχή) is an ancient Greek term meaning "origin," "source," or "principle." In [[Presocratic Philosophy]], it refers to the fundamental substance or first principle from which all things are derived. The concept of arche was central to the inquiries of the [[Ionian School]] and laid the foundation for metaphysical exploration in Western philosophy.

## Key Thinkers and Their Interpretations of Arche
### [[Thales of Miletus]]
- Proposed that **[[water]]** is the arche, as it is essential for life and capable of transformation.

### [[Anaximander]]
- Introduced the concept of the **[[Apeiron]]** (the infinite or boundless) as the arche, arguing that it was an indefinite and eternal source beyond the traditional elements.

### [[Anaximenes]]
- Suggested that **[[air]]** is the arche, transforming into other substances through processes of rarefaction and condensation.

### [[Heraclitus]]
- Identified **[[fire]]** as the arche, emphasizing constant change and the unity of opposites.

### [[Empedocles]]
- Proposed four elements—**[[earth]]**, **[[air]]**, **[[fire]]**, and **[[water]]**—as coexisting arche principles, governed by the forces of **love** and **strife**.

### [[Anaxagoras]]
- Introduced the concept of **[[nous]]** (mind) as the organizing principle or arche that orders the cosmos.

### [[Democritus]]
- Suggested that **atoms** and the **void** constitute the arche, forming the first atomic theory.

## Importance of Arche
1. **Shift from Mythology to Rational Inquiry**:
   - Replaced mythological explanations with naturalistic and rational approaches to understanding the cosmos.
   - Marked a pivotal transition in thought during the [[Presocratic Philosophy]] era.

2. **Foundation of Metaphysics**:
   - The search for arche laid the groundwork for later philosophical inquiries into being, substance, and causality. See [[Metaphysics]].

3. **Influence on Later Philosophers**:
   - The concept of arche influenced the metaphysical frameworks of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] and their notions of forms and substances.

## Related Concepts
- **[[Apeiron]]**: Anaximander's arche as the boundless or infinite.
- **[[Nous]]**: Anaxagoras' arche as the cosmic mind.
- **[[Four Elements]]**: Empedocles' theory of multiple arche principles.
