**Scholasticism** is a medieval philosophical and theological tradition that sought to reconcile [[Christian Theology]] with the rational methods of [[Aristotle]]. It flourished from the 12th to 17th centuries in Europe, primarily in universities, and aimed to systematize knowledge through rigorous logical analysis and debate.

## Key Characteristics
1. **Synthesis of Faith and Reason**:
   - Scholastic thinkers believed that faith and reason were complementary and could be harmonized.
   - Drew heavily on the works of [[Aristotle]], integrating his philosophy with [[Christian Theology]].

2. **Dialectical Method**:
   - Employed logical argumentation to resolve contradictions and clarify theological and philosophical issues. See [[Dialectic]].
   - Commonly presented in the form of *quaestiones* (questions) and *disputationes* (disputations).

3. **Emphasis on Authority**:
   - Built upon the writings of key authorities, including [[The Bible]], [[Church Fathers]], and classical philosophers like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].

4. **Categorization of Knowledge**:
   - Scholastics aimed to organize and systematize all human knowledge into a unified framework.

## Key Thinkers
### [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274)
- Synthesized [[Aristotle]]’s philosophy with Christian doctrine in *[[Summa Theologica]]*.
- Developed natural theology and argued for the compatibility of reason and divine revelation.

### [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033–1109)
- Known for the **Ontological Argument** for the existence of God.
- Emphasized the principle of *fides quaerens intellectum* (faith seeking understanding).

### [[William of Ockham]] (1287–1347)
- Advocated for philosophical simplicity, known as **Ockham’s Razor**.
- Questioned excessive reliance on metaphysical speculation.

### [[Duns Scotus]] (1266–1308)
- Explored the nature of individuality (*haecceity*) and the will’s role in ethical decision-making.
- Emphasized the importance of divine freedom and contingency.

## Legacy
1. **Theological Foundations**:
   - Scholasticism shaped the intellectual tradition of the Catholic Church.
   - Influenced theological debates during the [[Reformation]].

2. **Philosophy**:
   - Integrated [[Aristotelian Logic]] into Western thought, contributing to the development of [[Rationalism]].
   - Influenced figures like [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Leibniz]].

3. **Science and Education**:
   - Laid the groundwork for systematic inquiry and the university model of education.

## Critiques and Decline
- Criticized for excessive focus on abstract, speculative problems ("how many angels can dance on the head of a pin").
- Declined during the Renaissance as thinkers like [[Francis Bacon]] and [[René Descartes]] emphasized empirical and scientific methods over purely logical reasoning.
