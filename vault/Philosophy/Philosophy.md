**Philosophy** (from the Greek *philosophia*, meaning "love of wisdom") is the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It seeks to understand the principles underlying reality and human experience through rational inquiry and critical thinking.

## Key Branches of Philosophy
1. **Metaphysics**:
   - The study of being, existence, and the nature of reality.
   - Includes questions about causality, substance, space, and time. See [[Metaphysics]] and [[Aristotle]].

2. **Epistemology**:
   - The study of knowledge and belief.
   - Investigates the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. See [[Epistemology]] and [[Plato]].

3. **Ethics**:
   - The study of morality and the principles of right and wrong.
   - Includes normative ethics, metaethics, and applied ethics. See [[Virtue Ethics]], [[Utilitarianism]], and [[Kant]].

4. **Logic**:
   - The study of reasoning and argumentation.
   - Includes formal systems of deduction and inference. See [[Aristotelian Logic]] and [[Syllogism]].

5. **Aesthetics**:
   - The study of beauty, art, and taste.
   - Examines questions about the nature of art and aesthetic experience. See [[Form of Beauty]].

6. **Political Philosophy**:
   - The study of government, justice, rights, and the ideal state.
   - Explored by thinkers like [[Plato]] (*[[The Republic]]*) and [[John Locke]].

## Historical Development
### Ancient Philosophy
- **Pre-Socratics**:

### Medieval Philosophy
- Integrated [[Christian Theology]] with [[Aristotle]]’s philosophy.
- Key figures: [[Thomas Aquinas]] (*[[Summa Theologica]]*) and [[Anselm of Canterbury]].

### Modern Philosophy

## Core Methods
1. **Dialectic**:

   - In modern philosophy, emphasizes observation and experimentation in forming knowledge.

## Applications of Philosophy
1. **Ethics and Morality**:
