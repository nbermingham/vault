**Thales of Miletus** (c. 624–546 BCE) is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy" and one of the first thinkers of the [[Presocratic Philosophy]] era. He was a central figure in the [[Ionian School]], known for his naturalistic explanations of the cosmos and his proposition that [[water]] is the fundamental substance (*arche*) of all things.

## Key Contributions
- **Arche as Water**: Thales proposed that [[water]] is the primary substance underlying all matter. He observed that water is essential for life and changes state (solid, liquid, gas), making it a versatile candidate for the origin of all things.
- **Cosmology**: Suggested that the Earth floats on water, explaining earthquakes as disturbances in this medium.
- **Natural Philosophy**: Moved away from mythological explanations and emphasized rational inquiry and observation. See [[Natural Philosophy]].

## Achievements
- **Astronomy**:
  - Predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BCE, demonstrating the predictive power of rational thought.
  - Identified the solstices and suggested navigation using the stars.
- **Mathematics**:
  - Credited with introducing geometry to Greece. See [[Geometry]].
  - Developed the concept of Thales' Theorem, stating that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where AC is the diameter, then ∠ABC is a right angle. See [[Thales' Theorem]].

## Legacy
Thales' work laid the foundation for both [[Philosophy]] and [[science]]. His emphasis on natural explanations inspired subsequent thinkers like [[Anaximander]] and [[Anaximenes]].
