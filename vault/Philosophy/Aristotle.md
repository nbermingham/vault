**Aristotle** (384–322 BCE) was a Greek philosopher, scientist, and student of [[Plato]]. He is considered one of the most influential figures in Western thought, contributing to nearly every field of knowledge, including [[Philosophy]], [[science]], [[ethics]], [[politics]], [[logic]], and [[Metaphysics]]. His works form the foundation of many modern disciplines.

## Key Contributions
### Metaphysics
- Rejected Plato's [[Theory of Forms]].
  - Argued that forms (or essences) do not exist separately but are embedded within objects themselves.
- Introduced the concept of **substance** (*ousia*):
  - A combination of **form** (essence) and **matter** (physical substance).
- Developed the **Four Causes** as a framework for explaining change and existence:
  1. **Material Cause**: What something is made of.
  2. **Formal Cause**: Its form or essence.
  3. **Efficient Cause**: The agent or process that brings it into being.
  4. **Final Cause**: Its purpose or goal (*telos*). See [[Teleology]].

### Logic
- Founded formal logic and created the **[[syllogism]]**, a method of deductive reasoning.
- His works on logic are compiled in *[[Organon]]*, a collection of treatises that became the foundation of [[logic]] for centuries.

### Ethics
- Developed **[[Virtue Ethics]]**, emphasizing the cultivation of character and virtue over rules or consequences.
  - Defined virtue as the "mean" between two extremes (e.g., courage is a balance between recklessness and cowardice).
  - Happiness (*eudaimonia*) is the highest good, achieved through living a life of virtue and reason.

### Politics
- Explored the nature of the state and the role of the individual in *[[Politics]]*.
  - Advocated for a mixed government combining monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.
  - Believed the purpose of the state is to promote virtue and the good life for its citizens.

### Science and Biology
- Observed and classified plants, animals, and natural phenomena, laying the groundwork for empirical science.
- Proposed a geocentric model of the universe, later refined by [[Ptolemy]] and challenged by [[Copernicus]].

### Rhetoric and Poetics
- In *[[Rhetoric]]*, analyzed persuasion and its components:
  1. **Logos**: Logical argument.
  2. **Pathos**: Emotional appeal.
  3. **Ethos**: Credibility of the speaker.
- In *[[Poetics]]*, defined tragedy and introduced concepts like catharsis and the three unities (action, time, place).

## Major Works
- *[[Nicomachean Ethics]]*: Explores virtue and the good life.
- *[[Politics]]*: Examines governance and the role of the state.
- *[[Metaphysics]]*: Investigates being and substance.
- *[[Organon]]*: A collection of works on [[logic]].
- *[[Poetics]]*: Studies art, literature, and tragedy.
- *[[Rhetoric]]*: Discusses persuasion and communication.

## Legacy
1. **Influence on Philosophy**:
   - Opposed [[Plato]]’s idealism, favoring an empirical and practical approach.
   - Influenced [[Aquinas]] and medieval [[Scholasticism]], integrating Aristotle’s ideas with Christian theology.
2. **Impact on Science**:
   - His emphasis on observation and classification influenced the development of modern science, despite the eventual rejection of some of his specific theories.
3. **Modern Relevance**:
   - His ideas on [[virtue ethics]] remain a cornerstone of contemporary moral philosophy.
