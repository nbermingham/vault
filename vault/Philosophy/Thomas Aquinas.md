# Thomas Aquinas

**Thomas Aquinas** (1225–1274) was an Italian Dominican friar, theologian, and philosopher. He is best known for synthesizing [[Christian Theology]] with the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], creating a comprehensive system of thought that became central to [[Scholasticism]]. His most influential work, *[[Summa Theologica]]*, addresses questions of [[Metaphysics]], [[ethics]], and [[natural theology]].

## Key Contributions
### Synthesis of Faith and Reason
- Aquinas argued that reason and revelation are complementary paths to truth.
- Developed **natural theology**, demonstrating how the existence and attributes of God can be known through reason and observation. See [[Five Ways]].

### The Five Ways
- Aquinas proposed five arguments for the existence of God in *[[Summa Theologica]]*:
  1. **Motion**: The world is in motion, requiring a "First Mover" (God). See [[Unmoved Mover]].
  2. **Causation**: Every effect has a cause, requiring a "First Cause."
  3. **Contingency**: Contingent beings exist, but there must be a necessary being (God).
  4. **Gradation**: Degrees of perfection imply the existence of an ultimate standard.
  5. **Teleological Argument**: The apparent design in nature points to a designer.

### Virtue Ethics and Natural Law
- Expanded on [[Aristotle]]’s [[Virtue Ethics]], integrating it with Christian theology.
- Developed the concept of **natural law**:
  - Moral principles derived from human nature and reason.
  - Universal and accessible to all rational beings.

### Theology and the Nature of God
- Emphasized God as pure act (*actus purus*) and the necessary being.
- Explored divine attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and perfect goodness.
- Distinguished between:
  - **Essence** (*what God is*): Beyond human comprehension.
  - **Existence** (*that God is*): Demonstrable through reason.

### Epistemology
- Advocated for the compatibility of reason and revelation.
- Argued that human knowledge begins with sensory experience but is elevated through intellect and divine grace.

## Major Works
### *[[Summa Theologica]]*
- A comprehensive guide to theology and philosophy.
- Structured into three main parts:
  1. **God**: Nature, existence, and attributes.
  2. **Man**: Human purpose, virtues, and morality.
  3. **Christ**: Salvation and the sacraments.

### *Summa Contra Gentiles*
- Aimed at providing a rational defense of Christianity for non-believers.
- Focused on natural theology and philosophical arguments for the existence of God.

### Commentaries on Aristotle
- Aquinas wrote extensive commentaries on Aristotle’s works, integrating them with Christian theology.

## Legacy
1. **Scholasticism**:
   - Aquinas became the central figure of the [[Scholasticism]] tradition.
   - His synthesis of Aristotle and Christian doctrine shaped medieval philosophy.
2. **Influence on Theology**:
   - Declared a Doctor of the Church and canonized as Saint Thomas Aquinas.
   - His ideas remain central to Catholic theology and are celebrated in the *[[Summa Theologica]]*.
3. **Modern Relevance**:
   - Influenced [[natural law theory]], [[virtue ethics]], and debates on the relationship between faith and reason.
