# Thales' Theorem

**Thales' Theorem** is a fundamental principle in [[Geometry]] attributed to [[Thales of Miletus]]. It states that if \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are points on a circle where \( AC \) is the diameter, then the angle \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle (90°).

## Statement of the Theorem
If \( AC \) is the diameter of a circle and \( B \) is any point on the circle, then:
\[
\angle ABC = 90^\circ
\]

## Key Concepts
- **Circle Geometry**: The theorem demonstrates the relationship between a circle's diameter and the angles formed by points on its circumference. See [[Geometry]].
- **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: Thales' Theorem is a specific case of the more general Inscribed Angle Theorem. See [[Inscribed Angle Theorem]].

## Historical Significance
- **Attributed to [[Thales of Miletus]]**: This theorem is one of the earliest known results in [[mathematics]] and was likely proven using empirical observations and logical reasoning.
- **Foundation of Greek Geometry**: Inspired the development of Euclidean geometry and subsequent mathematical theories.

## Applications
1. **Construction**: Used in constructing right angles in practical settings, such as architecture and engineering.
2. **Proofs**: Serves as a basis for proving other geometric theorems.
3. **Navigation**: Ancient sailors used geometry, including concepts derived from Thales' work, for navigation and mapmaking.

## Proof of the Theorem
- **Step 1**: Draw the diameter \( AC \) of a circle.
- **Step 2**: Select any point \( B \) on the circle.
- **Step 3**: Observe that \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in the circle, and \( \angle ABC \) subtends the diameter.
- **Step 4**: Using properties of inscribed angles, \( \angle ABC \) equals 90°.

For a full derivation, see [[Geometry]] and the concept of [[Inscribed Angles]].

## Legacy
- Thales' Theorem represents one of the first uses of deductive reasoning in [[mathematics]], influencing later mathematicians like [[Euclid]].
