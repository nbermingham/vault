## Overview  
Zeno of Citium was a Greek philosopher from Cyprus who founded the **Stoic school of philosophy** around 300 BCE in Athens. After being shipwrecked and losing his wealth, Zeno sought wisdom and began studying under various philosophical schools, eventually synthesizing their ideas into what became Stoicism.

## Philosophical Contributions  
### Founding of Stoicism  
- Established Stoicism as a system focused on:  
  - Living in harmony with **nature**.  
  - **Virtue** as the only true good.  
  - Mastering emotions through rational thought.  
- Taught at the [[Stoa Poikilē (Painted Porch)]] in Athens, which gave Stoicism its name.

### Influences on Zeno  
Zeno was influenced by:  
- **[[Cynicism]]:** Learned under Crates of Thebes, emphasizing asceticism and self-sufficiency.  
- **[[Socratic Thought]]:** Admired [[Socrates]]' rational approach to virtue and ethics.  
- **[[Heraclitus]]:** Adopted the idea of [[Universal Reason (Logos)]]  

### Legacy  
- Zeno laid the groundwork for later Stoics, such as **Cleanthes**, **Chrysippus**, and the Roman Stoics (Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius).  
- His philosophy shaped the development of ethics and logic in ancient Greece and remains relevant in modern self-help and psychology.  

## Key Teachings  
### 1. **Virtue as the Sole Good**  
   - Happiness (*eudaimonia*) comes from living a life of virtue.  
   - External goods (wealth, health) are "indifferents" – neither good nor bad in themselves.

### 2. **Reason and Nature**  
   - Reason is humanity's defining feature and should guide all actions.  
   - Living in accordance with nature involves understanding and accepting universal laws.

### 3. **The Role of Emotions**  
   - Destructive emotions arise from incorrect judgments.  
   - Virtuous living leads to peace of mind (*ataraxia*).
