**Christian Theology** is the study of the nature of God, Jesus Christ, and the teachings of Christianity, rooted in the [[Bible]] and the traditions of the Church. It encompasses [[Metaphysics]], [[ethics]], and doctrines concerning [[salvation]], [[creation]], and the [[afterlife]]. Central to Christian theology is the belief in one God, revealed through the [[Trinity]]: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

## Key Areas of Christian Theology
1. **Theology Proper (The Doctrine of God)**:
   - Explores God’s nature and attributes, such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence.
   - Emphasizes God as creator and sustainer of the universe.

2. **[[Christology]]**:
   - Focuses on the identity and work of Jesus Christ.
   - Central doctrines include the [[Incarnation]] (God becoming human in Jesus) and the [[Atonement]] (Jesus’ death and resurrection as the means of human salvation).

3. **[[Pneumatology]]**:
   - Studies the [[Holy Spirit]] and its role in the Church and the believer’s life.
   - Examines concepts like inspiration, sanctification, and spiritual gifts.

4. **[[Soteriology]]**:
   - The doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
   - Includes debates on grace, works, and predestination. See [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Pelagianism]].

5. **[[Ecclesiology]]**:
   - The study of the Church’s nature, structure, and mission.
   - Examines sacraments like [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].

6. **[[Eschatology]]**:
   - The study of the end times, including topics like resurrection, judgment, and eternal life.
   - Explores interpretations of the [[Book of Revelation]].

## Historical Development
### Early Church (1st–5th Century)
- Key debates on the nature of [[Christ]] and the [[Trinity]] led to foundational creeds:
  - [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE): Defined the doctrine of the Trinity.
  - [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451 CE): Clarified the dual nature of Christ (fully divine and fully human).
- Influential figures:
  - **[[Augustine of Hippo]]**: Developed doctrines of original sin and grace.
  - **[[Athanasius of Alexandria]]**: Defended the divinity of Christ against [[Arianism]].

### Medieval Theology (5th–15th Century)
- [[Scholasticism]]: Integrated [[Aristotle]]’s philosophy with Christian thought.
  - **[[Thomas Aquinas]]** synthesized faith and reason in works like *[[Summa Theologica]]*.
- Development of [[Natural Theology]]: Arguing for God’s existence through reason and observation.

### Reformation and Counter-Reformation (16th Century)
- Key figures like [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] challenged traditional doctrines, emphasizing salvation by faith and the authority of Scripture.
- [[The Catholic Church]] responded with the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563), reaffirming core teachings and reforming Church practices.

### Modern and Contemporary Theology
- **[[Liberal Theology]]**: Emphasized reason and experience over traditional doctrines.
- **[[Neo-Orthodoxy]]**: Reacted against liberal theology, focusing on the transcendence of God (e.g., [[Karl Barth]]).
- **[[Liberation Theology]]**: Focused on social justice and the plight of the poor.

## Key Texts and Creeds
- **[[Bible]]**: The foundational text of Christian theology.
- **[[Nicene Creed]]**: A statement of faith in the Trinity.
- **[[Summa Theologica]]** by [[Thomas Aquinas]]: Systematic theology integrating faith and reason.

## Legacy and Influence
1. **Philosophy**:
   - Influenced Western [[Metaphysics]], [[ethics]], and debates about the nature of God and morality.
   - Thinkers like [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Hegel]] engaged deeply with Christian theological ideas.
2. **Culture and Society**:
   - Shaped art, literature, and laws in Christian-majority societies.
