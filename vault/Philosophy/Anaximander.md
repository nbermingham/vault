**Anaximander** (c. 610–546 BCE) was a Greek philosopher from [[Miletus]] and a prominent figure in the [[Ionian School]] of [[Presocratic Philosophy]]. A student of [[Thales of Miletus]], he made significant contributions to cosmology, geography, and [[Philosophy]]. He is best known for introducing the concept of the **[[Apeiron]]**, or the "infinite" as the arche (fundamental principle) of the universe.

## Key Contributions
### The Apeiron
- Anaximander proposed the **[[Apeiron]]** (ἄπειρον), meaning the "infinite" or "boundless," as the arche.
- He argued that:
  - The apeiron is eternal, unchanging, and the source of all things.
  - It generates opposites (e.g., hot and cold, wet and dry), which combine to form the cosmos.

### Cosmology
- Suggested a mechanical and rational explanation of the universe, replacing mythological narratives. See [[Natural Philosophy]].
- Proposed that the Earth is:
  - Cylindrical in shape and floats freely in space, unsupported.
  - Centered in the cosmos, equidistant from everything.
- Developed an early model of the celestial bodies, suggesting that the Sun, Moon, and stars revolve around the Earth.

### Early Evolutionary Ideas
- Suggested that humans originated from other life forms, possibly fish, because human infants are born helpless and require nurturing.

### Geography
- Credited with creating one of the earliest maps of the known world. See [[Early Cartography]].
- Introduced the concept of a spherical Earth (later refined by [[Pythagoras]] and [[Aristotle]]).

## Works
- **[[On Nature]]**: A treatise attributed to Anaximander, though it survives only in fragments.
  - Explores the nature of existence, the apeiron, and the origins of life and the cosmos.

## Legacy
- **Influence on Later Thinkers**:
  - His ideas about the apeiron and naturalistic explanations influenced [[Anaximenes]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Aristotle]].
- **Foundation of Cosmology**:
  - Anaximander's use of observation and reasoning marked a significant step in the development of science and philosophy.

## Related Concepts
- **[[Apeiron]]**: Anaximander's infinite principle, the source of all things.
- **[[Arche]]**: The fundamental principle of the cosmos.
- **[[Natural Philosophy]]**: The rational inquiry into the nature of the universe.
