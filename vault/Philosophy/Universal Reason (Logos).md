**Type:** Concept | Stoicism | Ancient Philosophy  
**Core Ideas:** [[Rational Order]], [[Divine Principle]], [[Cosmic Law ]] 

## Overview  
The **Logos** is a central concept in ancient philosophy, particularly in **[[Stoicism]]**, where it refers to the rational, divine principle that organizes and governs the universe. The word *logos* can mean "word," "reason," or "principle," and Stoics believed it to be the essence of logic and nature's rationality.

## Stoic Interpretation  
- **[[Cosmic Reason]]:** The Logos is the reason inherent in the universe, ensuring harmony and order.  
- **[[Human Connection]]:** Humans, as rational beings, have a fragment of the Logos within them, allowing them to align their actions with universal principles.  
- **[[Living According to Nature]]:** Stoics advocate living in accordance with the Logos to achieve virtue and inner peace.

## Origins and Influences  
- **[[Heraclitus]]:** Early Greek philosopher who first articulated the concept of Logos as the unifying principle of the cosmos.  
- **[[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]:** Influenced the Stoics with their emphasis on reason and the rational soul.  
- **[[Christianity]]:** Later adapted Logos as a theological concept, referring to Christ as the "Word" in the Gospel of John.

## Key Characteristics  
### 1. **[[Rational Order]]**  
   - The Logos ensures the universe operates in a predictable, logical way.  
   - Nature is governed by unchanging laws (physics, ethics).  

### 2. **Divine Principle**  
   - Stoics viewed the Logos as both immanent (present in all things) and transcendent (greater than individual parts).  
   - It acts as the "soul" of the cosmos.

### 3. **Ethical Implications**  
   - By understanding the Logos, individuals can discern what is good and virtuous.  
   - Emotional disturbances arise from failing to align with the Logos.
