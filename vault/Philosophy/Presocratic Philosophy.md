**Presocratic Philosophy** refers to the early Greek thinkers who laid the groundwork for Western philosophy before [[Socrates]]. They were primarily concerned with understanding the cosmos, nature, and the origins of existence through rational explanations rather than mythological narratives.

## Key Features
1. **[[Natural Philosophy]]**: Focused on the nature of the universe (*physis*) and sought to explain natural phenomena without relying on mythology.
2. **[[Search for Arche]]**: The [[Arche]] is the fundamental principle or substance underlying all things (e.g., water, air, or an indefinite substance).
3. **[[Cosmology]]**: Attempted to understand the origin, structure, and order of the cosmos.
4. **[[Rational Inquiry]]**: Emphasized reasoning and observation to understand reality.

## Major Presocratic Philosophers
### [[Ionian School]]
- **[[Thales of Miletus]]**: Proposed that water is the fundamental substance (arche) of all things.
- **[[Anaximander]]**: Introduced the concept of the *apeiron* (the infinite or boundless) as the source of all things.
- **[[Anaximenes]]**: Suggested air as the arche, transforming through rarefaction and condensation.

### [[Italian School]]
- **[[Pythagoras]]**: Believed in the centrality of numbers and mathematical harmony in the structure of the universe.
- **[[Parmenides]]**: Argued that reality is unchanging and that change is an illusion.
- **[[Zeno of Elea]]**: Known for paradoxes that challenge the concept of motion and plurality.

### [[Pluralists]] and [[Atomists]]
- **[[Empedocles]]**: Proposed four fundamental elements (earth, air, fire, water) and forces of love and strife.
- **[[Anaxagoras]]**: Introduced the concept of *nous* (mind) as the organizing principle of the cosmos.
- **[[Democritus]]**: Developed the first atomic theory, proposing that everything consists of indivisible atoms moving in a void.

## Influential Ideas
- The Presocratics shifted thinking from mythological explanations to rational, logical frameworks.
- They influenced later philosophers, including Socrates, [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].
