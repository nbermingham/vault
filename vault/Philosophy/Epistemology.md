**Epistemology** is the branch of [[Philosophy]] concerned with the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. It explores what it means to know something, how knowledge is acquired, and how we differentiate justified beliefs from opinions or falsehoods.

## Key Questions in Epistemology

1. **What is Knowledge?**
   - Traditional definition: **[[Justified true belief]]** (JTB). For someone to "know" something:
     1. It must be true.
     2. They must believe it.
     3. They must have justification for their belief.
   - Critiques: The [[Gettier Problem]] demonstrates situations where JTB may not suffice.

2. **What Are the Sources of Knowledge?**
   - **Perception**: Knowledge through sensory experience.
   - **Reason**: Knowledge derived from logical and mathematical reasoning. See [[Rationalism]].
   - **Introspection**: Knowledge of one’s own thoughts and feelings.
   - **Testimony**: Knowledge gained from others’ accounts.
   - **Faith**: Explored in religious contexts, such as in [[Christian Theology]].

3. **What Are the Limits of Knowledge?**
   - Addresses skepticism about what we can truly know.
   - Includes questions about the extent of human understanding in fields like [[science]] and [[Metaphysics]].

## Historical Development
### Ancient Philosophy
- **[[Plato]]**:
  - Defined knowledge as true belief with an account (*logos*). See [[Theory of Forms]].
  - Distinguished between:
    - **Episteme**: True knowledge, associated with the eternal realm of the [[Forms]].
    - **Doxa**: Opinion, associated with the material world.
- **[[Aristotle]]**:
  - Developed a systematic approach to knowledge based on observation and reasoning.

### Medieval Philosophy
- Integrated epistemology with [[Christian Theology]].
- **[[Thomas Aquinas]]**:
  - Argued that knowledge comes from both reason and divine revelation.
- **[[Augustine of Hippo]]**:
  - Explored the relationship between faith and understanding.

### Modern Philosophy
- Shifted focus to individual perception and justification.
- **[[René Descartes]]**:
  - Advocated for foundationalism in *[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]*, beginning with the certainty of "I think, therefore I am" (*cogito, ergo sum*).
- **[[John Locke]]**:
  - Emphasized [[empiricism]], claiming all knowledge originates from sensory experience.
- **[[David Hume]]**:
  - Advanced radical empiricism and skepticism about causality and the self.
- **[[Immanuel Kant]]**:
  - Sought to reconcile empiricism and rationalism, proposing that knowledge arises from the interaction between sensory input and mental categories. See *[[Critique of Pure Reason]]*.

### Contemporary Epistemology
- **Reliabilism**:
  - Suggests that beliefs are justified if they are formed through reliable processes.
- **Virtue Epistemology**:
  - Focuses on intellectual virtues like open-mindedness and intellectual humility.
- **Social Epistemology**:
  - Examines the role of social contexts and collective practices in knowledge formation.

## Core Concepts
1. **Skepticism**:
   - Questions whether knowledge is possible.
   - Explored by ancient skeptics like [[Pyrrho]] and modern thinkers like [[David Hume]].
2. **Foundationalism**:
   - Beliefs are justified by resting on self-evident truths or axioms.
3. **Coherentism**:
   - Justification arises from the coherence of beliefs within a system.
4. **Empiricism vs. Rationalism**:
   - [[Empiricism]]: Knowledge originates in sensory experience (e.g., [[John Locke]]).
   - [[Rationalism]]: Knowledge arises from reason and innate ideas (e.g., [[René Descartes]]).
5. **Justification**:
   - Explores what counts as adequate evidence or reasoning for belief.

## Legacy and Influence
1. **Impact on Science**:
   - Epistemology underpins the scientific method, emphasizing observation, hypothesis testing, and justification.
2. **Role in Technology**:
   - Influences debates on [[artificial intelligence]] and machine learning, especially concerning knowledge representation and reasoning.
3. **Ethical and Social Implications**:
   - Explores the reliability of testimony, the dissemination of misinformation, and collective knowledge in the digital age.
