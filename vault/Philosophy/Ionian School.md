The **Ionian School** is one of the earliest philosophical traditions, originating in [[Ionia]] (modern-day Turkey). It is characterized by a focus on natural philosophy and the search for the fundamental substance (*arche*) underlying all things.

## Key Features
- **Natural Philosophy**: Sought rational explanations for natural phenomena instead of relying on mythology. See [[Presocratic Philosophy]].
- **Arche**: The search for the fundamental principle or substance that constitutes the universe. See [[Arche]].

## Major Thinkers

- Often regarded as the "Father of Western Philosophy."
- Contributions:
  - Predicted solar eclipses.
  - Believed in the interconnectedness of all things.
  - Suggested that the Earth floats on water.

### [[Anaximander]]
- Introduced the concept of the *[[Apeiron]]* (the infinite or boundless) as the source of all things.
- Contributions:
