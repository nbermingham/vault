**Metaphysics** is a branch of [[Philosophy]] that investigates the fundamental nature of reality, existence, and the underlying structure of the universe. It explores concepts such as being, substance, causality, space, time, and the relationship between mind and matter.

## Key Questions in Metaphysics
1. **What is Being?**
   - Explores the nature of existence and what it means for something to "be."
   - See [[Aristotle]]’s discussion of *being qua being* in *[[Metaphysics]]*.

2. **What is Reality?**
   - Investigates the distinction between appearance and reality.
   - See [[Plato]]’s [[Theory of Forms]] for the division between the material world and the eternal realm of Forms.

3. **What is Causality?**
   - Examines the causes and principles underlying phenomena.
   - See [[Aristotle]]’s [[Four Causes]] and discussions of [[Teleology]].

4. **What is the Nature of the Universe?**
   - Addresses questions about space, time, and the nature of the cosmos.
   - Explored in works like [[Kant]]’s *Critique of Pure Reason*.

5. **What is the Mind-Body Relationship?**
   - Investigates how mental and physical states interact.
   - See [[Cartesian Dualism]] by [[René Descartes]].

## Historical Development
### Presocratic Philosophy
- Early thinkers like [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Anaximander]] explored the **arche** (first principle) of all things.
- Focused on natural explanations for the cosmos. See [[Natural Philosophy]].

### Plato
- Introduced the [[Theory of Forms]], positing a dual reality:
  - The eternal world of Forms (true reality).
  - The material world (imperfect reflection of the Forms).
- Discussed in works like *[[The Republic]]* and *[[The Symposium]]*.

### Aristotle
- Rejected Plato’s separation of Forms and proposed a more integrated approach.
- In *[[Metaphysics]]*, introduced concepts such as **substance**, **potentiality and actuality**, and the **Unmoved Mover**.

### Medieval Metaphysics
- Synthesized [[Aristotle]] with [[Christian Theology]], emphasizing God as the ultimate cause and sustainer of the universe.
- Key figures: [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Avicenna]].

### Modern Metaphysics
- **René Descartes**: Developed [[Cartesian Dualism]], distinguishing mind and matter.
- **Immanuel Kant**: Investigated the limits of human understanding in *[[Critique of Pure Reason]]*.

### Contemporary Metaphysics
- Explores topics like identity, free will, and the nature of time and space.
- Influenced by developments in [[physics]], [[logic]], and [[analytic philosophy]].

## Key Concepts
1. **Substance**:
   - The underlying essence of things.
   - Central to [[Aristotle]]’s metaphysics.
2. **Causality**:
   - The study of causes, including material, formal, efficient, and final causes.
   - See [[Four Causes]] and [[Teleology]].
3. **Universals and Particulars**:
   - Explores the relationship between general concepts (universals) and specific instances (particulars).
   - See [[Plato]]’s [[Theory of Forms]] and [[Aristotle]]’s critique.
4. **Mind-Body Problem**:
   - Investigates the relationship between mental and physical phenomena.
   - See [[Cartesian Dualism]] and alternatives like [[Materialism]].

## Legacy
1. **Influence on Science**:
   - Metaphysical questions laid the groundwork for disciplines like [[physics]] and [[cosmology]].
2. **Theology and Philosophy**:
   - Metaphysics deeply influenced [[Christian Theology]], [[Islamic Philosophy]], and [[Scholasticism]].
3. **Contemporary Thought**:
   - Continues to shape debates on consciousness, identity, and the nature of reality.
