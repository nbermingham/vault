**Eudaimonia** (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a central concept in [[Aristotle]]’s philosophy, particularly in *[[Nicomachean Ethics]]*. Often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing," it represents the highest good and the ultimate goal of human life. Eudaimonia is achieved through living a life of virtue in accordance with reason.

## Key Characteristics
1. **Ultimate Goal**:
   - Eudaimonia is the end for which all actions aim. Unlike wealth, pleasure, or honor, it is valued for its own sake, not as a means to an end.
   - It is the **[[telos]]** (final purpose) of human existence. See [[Teleology]].

2. **Activity of the Soul**:
   - Defined as the **activity of the soul in accordance with virtue** over a complete life.
   - It is not a momentary state but a lifelong process.

3. **Rationality**:
   - Humans achieve eudaimonia by exercising their unique capacity for reason.
   - Rational activity aligns with the **intellectual virtues** and guides the development of **moral virtues**.

4. **Virtue and Eudaimonia**:
   - Living virtuously is essential to achieving eudaimonia. See [[Virtue Ethics]].
   - Virtue is a "mean" between extremes, such as courage being a balance between recklessness and cowardice.

5. **Self-Sufficiency**:
   - Eudaimonia must be self-sufficient, complete, and not dependent on external circumstances, although Aristotle acknowledges the role of external goods like health and friendship.

6. **Relation to Pleasure**:
   - While pleasure can accompany eudaimonia, it is not its essence. Pleasure arises from the fulfillment of virtuous activities.

## Achieving Eudaimonia
1. **Moral Virtues**:
   - Cultivated through habituation and practice, moral virtues (e.g., courage, temperance, justice) shape character and actions.
2. **Intellectual Virtues**:
   - Achieved through education and contemplation, intellectual virtues (e.g., wisdom, understanding) represent the highest human capacities.
3. **Friendship**:
   - Genuine friendships, based on mutual respect and shared virtue, support the flourishing life. See [[Friendship]].

## The Contemplative Life
- Aristotle considers the **contemplative life** (*bios theoretikos*) to be the highest form of eudaimonia.
  - It involves the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the divine and eternal truths.
  - Aligns with the **intellectual virtues** and the fulfillment of human potential.

## Comparisons with Other Philosophies
1. **Plato**:
   - Emphasized the **[[Form of the Good]]** as the ultimate goal, aligning eudaimonia with understanding eternal truths.
2. **Epicureanism**:
   - Focused on pleasure (*ataraxia*) as the highest good but recognized the importance of virtue in achieving it.
3. **Stoicism**:
   - Equated eudaimonia with living in harmony with nature and reason, emphasizing virtue as the sole requirement.

## Legacy
1. **Influence on Virtue Ethics**:
   - Eudaimonia remains central to [[Virtue Ethics]], which emphasizes character and the pursuit of the good life.
2. **Modern Philosophy**:
   - Influenced thinkers like [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (*[[After Virtue]]*) and contemporary discussions on well-being.
