**Nicomachean Ethics** is one of the most influential works by [[Aristotle]], focusing on the nature of virtue, the good life, and ethical reasoning. The text is named after Aristotle’s son, Nicomachus, and is foundational to [[Virtue Ethics]].

## Key Themes and Ideas
### The Highest Good: Eudaimonia
- **Eudaimonia**: Often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing," it is the ultimate goal of human life.
  - Eudaimonia is achieved through living a life of virtue in accordance with reason. See [[Eudaimonia]].
  - It is not momentary pleasure but a sustained and fulfilling life.

### Virtue as the Mean
- **[[Virtue]]** (*arete*): A disposition to act in the right way, cultivated through habit and practice.
- Defined as the "mean" between two extremes (deficiency and excess). Examples:
  - **[[Courage]]**: The mean between recklessness and cowardice.
  - **[[Temperance]]**: The mean between indulgence and insensitivity.
  - **[[Generosity]]**: The mean between wastefulness and stinginess.

### The Role of [[Reason]]
- Human beings are rational animals, and the exercise of reason is essential to achieving eudaimonia.
- Reason guides ethical decision-making and cultivates intellectual virtues (e.g., wisdom, understanding).

### Types of Virtues
1. **[[Moral Virtues]]**: Character traits like courage, temperance, and justice, developed through habituation.
2. **[[Intellectual Virtues]]**: Traits like wisdom (*sophia*) and practical judgment (*phronesis*), achieved through education and reasoning.

### [[Friendship]]
- Explored extensively in Books VIII and IX.
- Aristotle identifies three types of friendship:
  1. **[[Friendship of Utility]]**: Based on mutual benefit.
  2. **[[Friendship of Pleasure]]**: Based on shared enjoyment.
  3. **[[Friendship of the Good]]**: Based on mutual respect and shared virtue, the highest form of friendship.

### [[Justice]]
- Justice is the highest social virtue, encompassing fairness and lawfulness.
- Divided into:
  1. **[[Distributive Justice]]**: Fair allocation of resources based on merit.
  2. **[[Rectificatory Justice]]**: Addressing wrongs and restoring balance.

### [[The Contemplative Life]]
- Aristotle argues that the contemplative life (*bios theoretikos*), focused on intellectual pursuits and understanding truth, is the highest and most fulfilling life.

## Structure of the Text
- The **Nicomachean Ethics** is divided into ten books, each addressing different aspects of ethical philosophy:
  1. The Good and Eudaimonia.
  2. Moral Virtue and Habit.
  3. Moral Responsibility and Choice.
  4. Specific Virtues (e.g., courage, temperance).
  5. Justice and Fairness.
  6. Intellectual Virtues.
  7. Weakness of Will (*akrasia*).
  8. Friendship.
  9. Friendship and Eudaimonia.
  10. Pleasure and the Contemplative Life.

## Legacy
1. **Virtue Ethics**:
   - The text forms the foundation of [[Virtue Ethics]], which emphasizes character over rules or consequences.
2. **Influence on Philosophy**:
   - Influenced later philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and contemporary virtue ethicists.
3. **Practical Relevance**:
   - Continues to inspire discussions on moral education, personal development, and the nature of happiness.
