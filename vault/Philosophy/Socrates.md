**Socrates** (c. 470–399 BCE) was a classical Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Western philosophy. Known for his method of dialectical questioning, Socrates profoundly influenced his students, including [[Plato]], and the development of ethical philosophy and epistemology.

## Key Contributions
### Socratic Method
- A form of cooperative dialogue aimed at stimulating critical thinking and illuminating ideas.
- Process:
  1. Ask a question to probe beliefs.
  2. Expose contradictions or weaknesses in reasoning.
  3. Refine the belief or seek a deeper understanding.
- See [[Dialectic]] for related methods of inquiry.

### Ethical Philosophy
- Central Belief: **"The unexamined life is not worth living."**
  - Encouraged self-reflection to achieve moral virtue and wisdom.
- Rejected material wealth and physical pleasure as the basis of a good life.
- Linked knowledge with virtue: To know the good is to do the good.

### Socratic Ignorance
- Claimed to know nothing, emphasizing intellectual humility.
- Famous statement: **"I know that I know nothing."**

### Philosophy of Justice and Virtue
- Explored in works by [[Plato]], such as *[[The Republic]]* and *[[Crito]]*.
- Advocated for adherence to moral principles even in the face of adversity, as seen in his refusal to escape execution in *[[Crito]]*.

## Trial and Death
- Accused of corrupting the youth and impiety (disbelieving in the gods of Athens).
- Defended himself in his trial, recorded in *[[The Apology]]* by [[Plato]].
- Sentenced to death by drinking hemlock, becoming a martyr for philosophy.

### Legacy of the Trial
- Highlighted the tension between individual conscience and societal norms.
- Inspired future philosophical debates on civil disobedience and the nature of justice.

## Influence
- **[[Plato]]**: Preserved Socrates' teachings and methods in dialogues like *[[The Republic]]*, *[[The Symposium]]*, and *[[Phaedo]]*.
- **[[Aristotle]]**: Inherited ethical and logical foundations indirectly through Plato.
- **Stoicism**: Socrates’ emphasis on virtue and rationality influenced later schools like [[Stoicism]] and [[Cynicism]].

## Key Ideas
- **Virtue Ethics**: Focused on the cultivation of character rather than adherence to rules.
- **Moral Autonomy**: Encouraged individuals to think critically and independently.
- **The Role of the Philosopher**: Acted as a gadfly, challenging society to pursue truth and justice.
