## Overview
**Keras** is a high-level [[Deep Learning]] API built into [[TensorFlow]] that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It provides a user-friendly, modular interface for defining and training [[Neural Networks]] and is widely used for rapid prototyping, research, and production.

## Key Features

1. **User-Friendly**:
   - Offers simple and intuitive APIs for building models with minimal code.
2. **Modularity**:
   - Models are built by connecting standalone modules (e.g., layers, loss functions, optimizers).
3. **Integration with TensorFlow**:
   - Fully integrated with TensorFlow, providing access to TensorFlowâ€™s ecosystem for scaling, deployment, and visualization.
4. **Customizability**:
   - Allows custom layers, loss functions, and training loops for advanced use cases.

## Key Components

### **1. Sequential API**
- A straightforward API for stacking layers linearly. It is simple and intuitive for most standard architectures.

### **2. Functional API**
- For creating complex models, such as those with shared layers or multiple inputs/outputs, the Functional API provides flexibility.

### **3. Model Subclassing**
- For maximum flexibility, you can subclass the `Model` class to define custom behavior, particularly for non-standard architectures.

### **4. Callbacks**
- Predefined hooks for tasks like saving models, early stopping, or learning rate scheduling.

### **5. Preprocessing and Data Augmentation**
- Built-in tools for image preprocessing, tokenization, and data augmentation.

## Workflow

1. **Define the Model**:
   - Use the Sequential API, Functional API, or Model subclassing to define the architecture.
2. **Compile the Model**:
   - Specify the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
3. **Train the Model**:
   - Fit the model on training data and validate it on a separate validation set.
4. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Use evaluation metrics to assess performance on test data.
5. **Deploy the Model**:
   - Save the model and deploy it with TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite, or TensorFlow.js.

## Applications

1. **Computer Vision**:
   - Image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Tasks like [[Sentiment Analysis]], [[Machine Translation]], and text generation.
3. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Forecasting, anomaly detection, and sequential data modeling.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Training agents in simulated environments.
5. **Generative Models**:
   - Creating realistic images, text, or audio using [[GANs]].
