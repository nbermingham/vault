## Overview
**Partial Derivatives** are a fundamental concept in [[Calculus]] used to measure the rate of change of a multivariable function with respect to one variable, while keeping all other variables constant. They are widely used in [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]] for optimization, especially in algorithms like [[Gradient Descent]].

In mathematical terms, if $f(x, y)$ is a function of two variables, the partial derivative with respect to $x$ is:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
$$
This measures how $f$ changes as $x$ changes, holding $y$ constant.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Definition**
For a function $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, the partial derivative with respect to $x_i$ is:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \lim_{\Delta x_i \to 0} \frac{f(x_1, \dots, x_i + \Delta x_i, \dots, x_n) - f(x_1, \dots, x_i, \dots, x_n)}{\Delta x_i}
$$
This calculates the instantaneous rate of change in $f$ as $x_i$ varies, keeping all other variables constant.

### **2. Gradient**
The gradient is a vector of all partial derivatives for a function $f$:
$$
\nabla f = \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right]
$$
It points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function.

### **3. Second Partial Derivatives**
Second partial derivatives measure the curvature of the function:
$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i^2}
$$
or mixed partial derivatives:
$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}
$$

## Example

For the function:
$$
f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2
$$
Partial derivatives are:
1. With respect to $x$:
   $$
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x + 3y
   $$
2. With respect to $y$:
   $$
   \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3x + 2y
   $$

The gradient is:
$$
\nabla f = [2x + 3y, 3x + 2y]
$$
