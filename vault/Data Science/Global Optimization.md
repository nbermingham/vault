## Overview
**Global Optimization** refers to the process of finding the absolute best solution (global optimum) to an optimization problem over its entire feasible domain. Unlike [[Local Optimization]], which finds the best solution within a restricted region, global optimization ensures that the solution is optimal across all possible regions, even in the presence of multiple local optima.

Global optimization is widely used in fields such as [[Machine Learning]], [[Physics]], engineering design, and financial modeling, where finding the optimal solution is critical for performance and efficiency.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Global Optimum**:
   - The point in the solution space where the objective function achieves its best possible value (minimum or maximum).
2. **Non-Convexity**:
   - Global optimization often deals with non-convex functions, where multiple local optima exist.
3. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Requires balancing exploration of the solution space with exploitation of promising regions.

## Techniques

1. **Deterministic Methods**:
   - Explore the entire solution space systematically.
   - Examples:
     - **Branch and Bound**: Divides the domain into smaller regions and eliminates suboptimal regions.
     - **Dynamic Programming**: Solves complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems.
   - Advantage: Guarantees finding the global optimum (for certain problem classes).
   - Disadvantage: Computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems.

2. **Stochastic Methods**:
   - Use randomness to explore the solution space.
   - Examples:
     - [[Simulated Annealing]]: Mimics the cooling process of metals to escape local optima.
     - [[Genetic Algorithms]]: Inspired by evolution, using mutation and crossover to optimize.
     - [[Particle Swarm Optimization]]: Models the movement of particles in search of the global optimum.
   - Advantage: Handles non-convex and high-dimensional problems efficiently.
   - Disadvantage: No guarantee of finding the global optimum.

3. **Hybrid Methods**:
   - Combine deterministic and stochastic techniques.
   - Example: Using [[Gradient Descent]] locally within a globally stochastic framework.

4. **Convex Relaxation**:
   - Approximate non-convex problems with convex ones, solving the latter to estimate the global optimum.

## Applications

1. **Machine Learning**:
   - Hyperparameter optimization for complex models like [[Neural Networks]] and [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]].
   - Training deep learning models with non-convex loss surfaces.
2. **Engineering Design**:
   - Optimizing the design of structures, systems, and processes.
3. **Economics and Finance**:
   - Portfolio optimization, option pricing, and risk minimization.
4. **Physics**:
   - Solving energy minimization problems and finding equilibrium states.

## Advantages

1. **Guarantees Optimality**:
   - Ensures the best possible solution is found.
2. **Broad Applicability**:
   - Can handle non-convex, high-dimensional, and multimodal problems.
3. **Flexible Techniques**:
   - Stochastic methods adapt well to diverse problem structures.

## Disadvantages

1. **Computational Cost**:
   - Exploring the entire solution space is resource-intensive, especially for high-dimensional problems.
2. **Convergence Issues**:
   - Stochastic methods may not converge to the true global optimum.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Techniques may struggle with very large or complex problems.
