## Overview
**Text preprocessing** is a crucial step in preparing raw text data for use in [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) tasks. It involves cleaning and transforming unstructured text into a structured format that can be effectively analyzed or used as input for machine learning models.

## Key Steps in Text Preprocessing

### 1. Text Cleaning
- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase for uniformity.
- **Removing Punctuation**: Eliminates special characters and punctuation marks unless they carry semantic meaning.
- **Removing Numbers**: Removes numerical values if they are irrelevant to the task.
- **Removing Stop Words**: Filters out common words (e.g., "is," "the," "and") that do not contribute to the meaning.
- **Removing Whitespace**: Strips extra spaces or line breaks.
- **Expanding Contractions**: Converts contractions (e.g., "don't") into their expanded forms ("do not").

---

### 2. Tokenization
- Splits text into smaller units like words, sentences, or subwords (tokens).
- Types:
  - **Word Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words.
  - **Sentence Tokenization**: Splits text into sentences.
  - **[[Subword Tokenization]]**: Breaks words into meaningful subunits (e.g., BPE in [[BERT]]).

---

### 3. Text Normalization
- Converts text into a consistent format.
- Techniques:
  - **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run").
  - **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their dictionary base form while preserving meaning (e.g., "running" → "run").

---

### 4. Text Encoding
- Converts text into numerical representations for machine learning models.
- Common encoding techniques:
  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents text as a sparse vector of word counts.
  - **[[TF-IDF]] (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weighs word importance based on frequency across documents.
  - **Embeddings**: Dense vector representations like [[Word2Vec]] and [[BERT]].

---

### 5. Handling Missing Data
- Strategies:
  - Remove rows with missing text.
  - Impute missing text with placeholders like "unknown" or "N/A."

---

### 6. Noise Removal
- Eliminates unwanted data, such as:
  - HTML tags
  - URLs
  - Emojis
  - Special characters

---

### 7. Stop Word Removal
- Removes frequently occurring words that do not add significant meaning.
- Common stop word lists:
  - [[NLTK]]’s stop word list.
  - SpaCy’s built-in stop word list.

---

### 8. Spelling Correction
- Corrects misspelled words using algorithms or libraries (e.g., SymSpell, Hunspell).

---

### 9. Text Augmentation
- Expands the dataset by creating variations of text samples.
- Techniques:
  - Synonym Replacement.
  - Back Translation (translating text to another language and back).
  - Random Insertion or Deletion of words.

---

## Applications
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Cleaning and tokenizing text before classifying sentiment.
- **Chatbots**: Normalizing input to understand user intent better.
- **Search Engines**: Tokenizing and stemming text for better search relevance.
- **Machine Translation**: Preparing text for sequence-to-sequence models like [[Transformers]].

---

## Challenges
1. **Language-Specific Preprocessing**:
   - Different languages require different preprocessing rules (e.g., stemming in English vs. lemmatization in Latin-based languages).
2. **Ambiguity**:
   - Contextual meanings can be lost in steps like stemming and removing stop words.
3. **Domain-Specific Text**:
   - Preprocessing must be tailored for specialized domains like legal, medical, or financial texts.

## Tools and Libraries

### Python Libraries
- **[[NLTK]] (Natural Language Toolkit)**:
  - Tokenization, stemming, stop word removal.
- **SpaCy**:
  - Fast and efficient library for tokenization, lemmatization, and more.
- **TextBlob**:
  - Simplified text preprocessing, including spelling correction and sentiment analysis.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**:
  - For advanced tokenization and embedding generation.
- **[[Scikit-learn]]**:
  - Implements Bag of Words, [[TF-IDF]], and preprocessing utilities.

## Best Practices
1. Tailor preprocessing steps to the specific NLP task.
2. Avoid over-cleaning; retain necessary information like punctuation or stop words if relevant.
3. Test the impact of preprocessing steps on downstream tasks to ensure performance improvement.
