## Overview
**Non-Convex Functions** are functions where the line segment between two points on the graph of the function does not necessarily lie above or on the graph. Unlike [[Convex Functions]], non-convex functions may have multiple local minima and maxima, making optimization more challenging.

Non-convex functions are common in real-world problems, particularly in [[Machine Learning]], [[Deep Learning]], and [[Physics]], where complex, non-linear relationships are modeled.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Multiple Local Optima**:
   - Non-convex functions can have several local minima and maxima, making it difficult to find the global optimum.
2. **Non-Linearity**:
   - These functions often represent highly non-linear relationships.
3. **Undefined Convexity**:
   - They do not satisfy the mathematical conditions for convexity, such as a positive semi-definite [[Hessian Matrix]].

## Examples

1. **Loss Surfaces in Deep Learning**:
   - The loss surfaces of models like [[Neural Networks]] are highly non-convex, with multiple valleys and peaks.
2. **Multimodal Functions**:
   - Functions like $f(x) = \sin(x)$ or $f(x) = x^4 - x^2$ are non-convex.
3. **Optimization in Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Non-convex reward landscapes are common.

## Applications

1. **Deep Learning**:
   - Training deep [[Neural Networks]] involves minimizing non-convex loss functions.
2. **Physics**:
   - Modeling energy landscapes with multiple stable states.
3. **Financial Modeling**:
   - Portfolio optimization problems are often non-convex due to constraints and complex relationships.
4. **Engineering**:
   - Design optimization problems with constraints and trade-offs.

## Challenges

1. **Local Minima**:
   - Optimization algorithms can get stuck in local minima, failing to find the global optimum.
2. **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**:
   - Gradients in non-convex loss surfaces can diminish or grow excessively during optimization.
3. **High Dimensionality**:
   - Non-convex functions in high-dimensional spaces are computationally expensive to optimize.

## Optimization Techniques for Non-Convex Functions

1. **Stochastic Methods**:
   - Use randomness to explore the solution space.
   - Examples: [[Simulated Annealing]], [[Genetic Algorithms]].
2. **Gradient-Based Methods**:
   - Algorithms like [[Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)]] can navigate non-convex loss surfaces effectively.
3. **Regularization**:
   - Techniques like [[Dropout]] and weight decay help mitigate overfitting and stabilize training.
4. **Initialization Strategies**:
   - Careful initialization of parameters can prevent poor convergence.
