## Overview
**Feature Engineering** is the process of creating, transforming, and selecting features from raw data to improve the performance of [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]] models. High-quality features are critical for achieving better predictive performance, as they allow algorithms to learn meaningful patterns from the data.

Feature Engineering often involves domain knowledge, mathematical transformations, and techniques like [[Dimensionality Reduction]] and [[Feature Selection]].

## Key Steps in Feature Engineering

### 1. **Feature Creation**
- Generate new features by combining or transforming existing data.
- Examples:
  - Ratios: Compute features like income-to-debt ratio.
  - Polynomial Features: Add powers or interactions of features to capture non-linear relationships.

### 2. **Feature Transformation**
- Apply mathematical transformations to improve feature interpretability or model performance.
- Common transformations:
  - [[Log Transform]]: Reduces skewness in data distributions.
  - [[Normalization]]: Scales features to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1).
  - [[Standardization]]: Scales features to have zero mean and unit variance.

### 3. **Feature Selection**
- Identify the most relevant features to reduce noise and improve computational efficiency.
- Techniques include:
  - Statistical methods like [[Correlation]] or mutual information.
  - Algorithms like [[Lasso Regression]] or [[Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)]].

## Techniques and Tools

### 1. **Handling Missing Data**
- Replace missing values with:
  - Mean, median, or mode (simple imputation).
  - Predictions from [[Imputation]] models like [[KNN Imputation]].

### 2. **Categorical Feature Encoding**
- Convert categorical variables into numerical representations:
  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Creates binary columns for each category.
  - **Target Encoding**: Uses the mean of the target variable for each category.

### 3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
- Reduce the number of features while retaining key information:
  - Techniques: [[Principal Component Analysis]] (Principal Component Analysis), [[t-SNE]], and [[UMAP]].

### 4. **Text Feature Engineering**
- Extract meaningful features from text for tasks like [[Natural Language Processing]]:
  - Bag of Words (BoW), [[TF-IDF]], and [[Word Embeddings]] (e.g., [[Word2Vec]], [[GloVe]]).

## Applications

1. **Improving Model Accuracy**:
   - High-quality features enhance the predictive power of [[Supervised Learning]] and [[Unsupervised Learning]] algorithms.
   
2. **Reducing Overfitting**:
   - Proper transformations and feature selection help prevent overfitting by removing noisy or irrelevant features.
   
3. **Boosting Computational Efficiency**:
   - Fewer, well-engineered features reduce model complexity and training time.

## Challenges

1. **Domain Expertise**:
   - Requires in-depth knowledge of the data and problem domain to engineer meaningful features.
   
2. **Overfitting**:
   - Aggressive feature creation may introduce noise or spurious relationships.
   
3. **High Dimensionality**:
   - Excessive features can lead to the [[Curse of Dimensionality]].
