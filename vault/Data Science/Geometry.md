# Geometry

**Geometry** is a branch of [[Mathematics for Data Science|Mathematics]] concerned with the properties and relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and shapes. Its origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with significant contributions from the [[Ionian School]] and later formalization by [[Euclid]].

## Historical Overview
1. **Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia**: Practical applications in land surveying and construction.
2. **Greek Geometry**:
   - Initiated by thinkers like [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Pythagoras]].
   - Formalized in *[[Elements]]* by [[Euclid]], which became the definitive text on geometry for centuries.
3. **Presocratic Contributions**:
   - [[Thales' Theorem]]: A pioneering result in circle geometry.
   - [[Pythagorean Theorem]]: A foundational principle connecting geometry and algebra.

## Key Concepts
- **Points and Lines**: Fundamental building blocks of geometry.
- **Angles**:
  - Right angles, as explored in [[Thales' Theorem]].
  - Acute, obtuse, and straight angles.
- **Shapes and Polygons**:
  - Triangles: Includes concepts like congruence and similarity.
  - Circles: Central to [[Thales' Theorem]] and the [[Inscribed Angle Theorem]].
- **Solids**:
  - Explored in later works like [[Euclid]]'s study of three-dimensional shapes.
  
## Key Thinkers and Contributions
- **[[Thales of Miletus]]**:
  - First known to use deductive reasoning in geometry.
  - Introduced [[Thales' Theorem]].
- **[[Pythagoras]]**:
  - Developed the [[Pythagorean Theorem]].
  - Explored the geometric significance of numbers.
- **[[Euclid]]**:
  - Wrote *[[Elements]]*, organizing geometry into axioms, theorems, and proofs.
- **[[Archimedes]]**:
  - Advanced geometry with studies on areas, volumes, and surfaces.

## Applications
1. **Practical Uses**:
   - Architecture, engineering, and navigation.
2. **Mathematical Foundations**:
   - Forms the basis for fields like [[trigonometry]], [[calculus]], and [[physics]].
3. **Philosophical Inquiry**:
   - Explored by [[Plato]] and others in metaphysical contexts.

## Legacy
Geometry remains a cornerstone of [[mathematics]] and science, with its principles influencing countless disciplines.
