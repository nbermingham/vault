## Overview
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping function from input features (\(X\)) to output labels (\(Y\)), enabling predictions on unseen data.

## Key Concepts
- **Input Features (\(X\))**: Independent variables or predictors.
- **Output Labels (\(Y\))**: Dependent variables or target outcomes.
- **Training Data**: Dataset containing known inputs and outputs for model learning.
- **Generalization**: The ability of a model to perform well on unseen data.

## Types of Supervised Learning

### **1. Regression**
Predicting continuous values.
- **Algorithms**:
  - [[Linear Regression]]
  - [[Ridge Regression]] and [[Lasso Regression]]
  - [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]]
- **Applications**:
  - Predicting housing prices.
  - Forecasting stock prices.

### **2. [[Classification]]**
Predicting discrete labels (e.g., categories or classes).
- **Algorithms**:
  - [[Logistic Regression]]
  - [[Decision Trees]] and [[Random Forests]]
  - [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]
  - [[Neural Networks]]
- **Applications**:
  - Spam email detection.
  - Medical diagnosis (e.g., disease [[Classification]]).

## Key Techniques
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting the most important features.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing or normalizing features for optimal model performance.
- **Cross-validation**: Assessing model performance on unseen data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy (e.g., grid search, random search).

## Metrics for Evaluation
- **Regression Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (\(R^2\))
- **[[Classification Metrics]]**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Score

## Workflow
1. **Define the Problem**:
   - What is the target variable? (e.g., class labels or continuous values)
2. **Collect Data**:
   - Gather labeled data for training.
3. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Clean, scale, and transform input features.
4. **Train Model**:
   - Select an appropriate algorithm and train on the dataset.
5. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Use metrics like accuracy, MSE, or ROC-AUC to assess performance.
6. **Optimize**:
   - Tune hyperparameters or improve feature selection.
7. **Deploy**:
   - Deploy the trained model into production.
