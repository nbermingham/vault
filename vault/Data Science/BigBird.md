## Overview
**BigBird** is a transformer model designed for long sequences, extending the capabilities of standard [[Transformers]] by implementing **Sparse Attention**. Developed by Google Research, BigBird combines **local attention**, **global attention**, and **random attention** patterns to achieve linear complexity, $O(n)$, compared to the quadratic complexity, $O(n^2)$, of [[Full Attention]].

BigBird enables efficient processing of sequences up to 16,384 tokens, making it ideal for tasks such as [[Document Classification]], [[Text Summarization]], and [[Question Answering]] over long contexts.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Sparse Attention in BigBird**
BigBird employs a combination of attention patterns to efficiently handle long sequences:
- **Local Attention**:
  - Each token attends to its neighboring tokens in a sliding window.
- **Global Attention**:
  - Selected tokens (e.g., [CLS] or query tokens) attend to all other tokens in the sequence.
- **Random Attention**:
  - Random token pairs are selected to improve connectivity and ensure theoretical guarantees of expressiveness (universal approximation).

This hybrid attention mechanism balances computational efficiency and expressiveness.

### **2. Attention Complexity**
- BigBird achieves $O(n)$ complexity by restricting the number of token pairs considered for attention.
- It maintains theoretical properties such as the ability to approximate [[Full Attention]] while being scalable for long sequences.

### **3. Theoretical Guarantees**
BigBird provides the following properties:
- **Universal Approximation**:
  - Can approximate any function modeled by Full Attention.
- **[[Turing Completeness]]**:
  - Supports computational tasks that require full contextual understanding.
- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - Reduces memory usage by focusing only on a subset of token relationships.

## Applications

1. **Document Classification**:
   - Processes lengthy documents like legal or scientific texts for classification tasks.
2. **Question Answering (QA)**:
   - Excels in answering queries over long contexts, such as open-domain QA tasks.
3. **Text Summarization**:
   - Summarizes lengthy articles or books efficiently.
4. **Bioinformatics**:
   - Analyzes long DNA or protein sequences.
5. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**:
   - Handles discourse analysis and coreference resolution in long contexts.

## Advantages

1. **Scalability**:
   - Processes sequences up to tens of thousands of tokens, which is infeasible for standard [[Transformers]].
   
2. **Hybrid Attention**:
   - Combines local, global, and random attention patterns for better context capture.

3. **Versatility**:
   - Applicable across a wide range of tasks, from [[NLP]] to bioinformatics.

4. **Efficient Training**:
   - Reduces computational costs compared to [[Full Attention]] models.

## Disadvantages

1. **Random Attention Dependency**:
   - May require tuning to select an appropriate random attention pattern for specific tasks.

2. **Complexity in Configuration**:
   - Determining the balance between local, global, and random attention patterns can be challenging.

3. **Task-Specific Limitations**:
   - For tasks requiring dense global context, performance may slightly lag behind Full Attention.
