## Overview
**Sentiment Analysis**, also known as **Opinion Mining**, is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that identifies and extracts the emotional tone of text. It classifies text as **positive**, **negative**, **neutral**, or more nuanced emotions like joy, anger, or sadness.

Sentiment Analysis is widely used in applications like social media monitoring, product reviews, and customer feedback analysis.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Sentiment Polarity**
- **Positive**: Indicates favorable sentiment (e.g., "I love this product").
- **Negative**: Indicates unfavorable sentiment (e.g., "This service is terrible").
- **Neutral**: Indicates neither positive nor negative sentiment (e.g., "The weather is okay").

### **2. Subjectivity**
- **Subjective Text**: Expresses personal opinions or feelings.
- **Objective Text**: States factual information without emotional tone.

### **3. [[Granularity]]**
- **Document-Level Sentiment**:
  - Assigns an overall sentiment to an entire document.
- **Sentence-Level Sentiment**:
  - Analyzes sentiment for each sentence.
- **Aspect-Level Sentiment**:
  - Identifies sentiment for specific aspects of an entity (e.g., "The food was great, but the service was slow").

## Techniques

### **1. [[Rule-Based Methods]]**
- Use predefined rules, dictionaries, and linguistic patterns to determine sentiment.
  - Example: Counting positive and negative words using a sentiment lexicon like [[VADER]] or SentiWordNet.

### **2. Machine Learning Methods**
- Use features like bag-of-words, [[TF-IDF]], and [[Embeddings]] with algorithms like:
  - [[Logistic Regression]]
  - [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]]
  - [[Naive Bayes]]

### **3. Deep Learning Methods**
- Use [[Neural Networks]] and [[Transformers]] for advanced sentiment analysis:
  - [[RNNs]] and [[LSTMs]] for sequential data.
  - [[BERT]] and [[GPT]] for contextual sentiment analysis.

## Applications

1. **Social Media Monitoring**:
   - Analyze customer sentiment toward brands or events on platforms like Twitter.
2. **Product Reviews**:
   - Assess consumer opinions on e-commerce platforms like Amazon.
3. **Customer Feedback**:
   - Measure customer satisfaction through surveys and feedback forms.
4. **Financial Analysis**:
   - Gauge market sentiment from news articles or earnings call transcripts.
5. **Healthcare**:
   - Detect emotional states in patient reviews or mental health applications.

## Example
Given a review:  
*"The product quality is excellent, but the delivery was delayed."*

- **Aspect-Level Sentiment**:
  - **Product Quality**: Positive
  - **Delivery**: Negative

## Advantages

1. **Insights into Public Opinion**:
   - Helps businesses understand customer satisfaction and preferences.
2. **Scalable**:
   - Automates analysis for large datasets like social media feeds.
3. **Customizable**:
   - Models can be fine-tuned for domain-specific sentiment (e.g., finance, healthcare).

## Disadvantages

1. **Ambiguity in Language**:
   - Sentiment analysis struggles with sarcasm, idioms, and context-dependent language.
2. **Domain Sensitivity**:
   - Models trained on general data may perform poorly in specialized domains.
3. **Imbalanced Data**:
   - Uneven distribution of positive, negative, and neutral examples can lead to biased results.
