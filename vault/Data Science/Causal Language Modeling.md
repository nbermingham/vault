## Overview
**Causal Language Modeling (CLM)** is a training objective commonly used in [[Decoder-Only Architecture]] models like [[GPT]] and [[GPT-3]]. It involves predicting the next token in a sequence based solely on the preceding tokens, adhering to the autoregressive property of causality. This unidirectional approach ensures that the model cannot access future tokens during training, making it ideal for [[Text Generation]] and other sequential tasks.

CLM is foundational to many [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]], enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Objective**
The primary goal of causal language modeling is to maximize the likelihood of the next token given all previous tokens:
$$
L = - \sum_{i=1}^n \log P(x_i \mid x_{<i})
$$
Where:
- $x_i$: The current token.
- $x_{<i}$: All preceding tokens in the sequence.

### **2. Autoregressive Property**
- Models trained with CLM predict tokens sequentially, from left to right.
- **Causal Masking**:
  - Prevents the model from attending to future tokens during training by masking positions beyond the current token.

---

### **3. Differences from Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**
- CLM uses a unidirectional context (past to future), while [[Masked Language Modeling (MLM)]] like [[BERT]] uses bidirectional context.
- CLM is better suited for [[Text Generation]], whereas MLM excels in [[Text Classification]] and [[Named Entity Recognition (NER)]].

## Applications

1. **Text Generation**:
   - Autoregressively generates coherent text for applications like story writing, conversational AI, and content creation.
2. **Machine Translation**:
   - Predicts tokens in the target language sequentially.
3. **Code Generation**:
   - Generates programming code based on natural language prompts (e.g., [[Codex]]).
4. **Language Modeling**:
   - Learns to model natural language distributions for general-purpose tasks.

## Advantages

1. **Simplicity**:
   - Easy to implement with [[Transformers]] using causal masking.
2. **Effective for Generation**:
   - Directly aligns with tasks requiring sequential output.
3. **Scalable**:
   - Scales well with larger datasets and more parameters.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Unidirectional Context**:
   - Cannot leverage future context, which may limit performance in some tasks.
2. **Training Cost**:
   - Requires significant computational resources for large-scale pre-training.
3. **Error Propagation**:
   - Errors in earlier tokens can compound during generation.
