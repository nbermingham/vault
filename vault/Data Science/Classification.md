## Overview
**Classification** is a type of supervised learning in [[Machine Learning]] where the goal is to predict the categorical label of a given input. The model learns to classify data into predefined classes or categories based on labeled training data. It is one of the most widely used tasks in machine learning, applicable in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and natural language processing.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Binary vs. Multi-Class Classification**
- **Binary Classification**:
  - Two possible classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam, yes vs. no).
- **Multi-Class Classification**:
  - Three or more classes (e.g., classifying images as cats, dogs, or birds).
- **Multi-Label Classification**:
  - An instance can belong to multiple classes simultaneously (e.g., tagging articles with multiple topics).

### **2. Decision Boundary**
- The surface that separates data points of different classes. In [[Linear Models]] like [[Logistic Regression]], this boundary is linear, whereas in [[Neural Networks]] or [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]], it can be non-linear.

### **3. Class Imbalance**
- Occurs when one class is significantly more frequent than others, leading to biased models.
  - Solution: Use techniques like resampling, [[Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)]], or weighted loss functions.

## Performance Metrics

1. **[[Accuracy]]**:
   - Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
2. **[[Precision]]**:
   - Proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.
3. **[[Recall]] (Sensitivity)**:
   - Proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
4. **[[F1-Score]]**:
   - Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
5. **[[ROC AUC]]**:
   - Evaluates the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
6. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - A table summarizing the model's prediction performance.

## Algorithms

### **1. Linear Models**
- **[[Logistic Regression]]**:
  - Suitable for binary classification tasks with a linear decision boundary.
- **[[Naive Bayes]]**:
  - Probabilistic classifier assuming feature independence.

### **2. Tree-Based Models**
- **[[Decision Trees]]**:
  - Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.
- **[[Random Forest]]**:
  - Ensemble of decision trees to improve performance.
- **[[Gradient Boosting]]**:
  - Boosting techniques like [[XGBoost]] or [[LightGBM]] for high accuracy.

### **3. Kernel Methods**
- **[[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]]**:
  - Effective for high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships.

### **4. Neural Networks**
- **[[Feedforward Neural Networks]]**:
  - Used for more complex classification tasks.
- **[[Transformers]]**:
  - State-of-the-art models for tasks like sentiment analysis and image recognition.

## Challenges

1. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Skewed class distributions lead to biased models.
   - Solution: Use balanced metrics like [[F1-Score]] or [[ROC AUC]].
2. **Overfitting**:
   - Occurs with overly complex models.
   - Solution: Use [[Cross-Validation]] and regularization techniques.
3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Irrelevant features can reduce model accuracy.
   - Solution: Use techniques like recursive feature elimination (RFE).
