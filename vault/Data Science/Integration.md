## Overview
**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a branch of [[Machine Learning]] where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions to maximize a reward signal over time. Unlike [[Supervised Learning]], RL does not rely on labeled data but instead learns from trial and error through feedback from the environment.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Agent, Environment, and Action**
- **Agent**: The decision-maker (e.g., a robot, algorithm, or program).
- **Environment**: The external system the agent interacts with.
- **Actions**: The set of all possible moves the agent can make.

### **2. Reward**
- A scalar value provided by the environment to indicate the success of an action.
- The agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

### **3. State**
- A representation of the environment at a given time.

### **4. Policy**
- A strategy that the agent uses to determine its actions based on the current state.
- Denoted as $\pi(a|s)$, representing the probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$.

### **5. Value Function**
- Measures the long-term reward of a state or state-action pair:
  - **State-Value Function**: $V(s)$, the expected return from state $s$.
  - **Action-Value Function**: $Q(s, a)$, the expected return from taking action $a$ in state $s$.

## Types of Reinforcement Learning

1. **Model-Free RL**:
   - The agent does not have access to the environment's dynamics and learns purely through interaction.
   - Algorithms: [[Q-Learning]], [[Deep Q-Networks (DQN)]].

2. **Model-Based RL**:
   - The agent builds a model of the environment to plan actions.
   - Suitable for structured environments.

3. **On-Policy vs. Off-Policy**:
   - **On-Policy**: The agent learns based on the current policy (e.g., SARSA).
   - **Off-Policy**: The agent learns from an exploratory policy but evaluates a target policy (e.g., Q-Learning).

## Algorithms

1. **Q-Learning**:
   - Model-free, off-policy algorithm that updates $Q(s, a)$ values to estimate the optimal action-value function.
2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**:
   - Combines [[Q-Learning]] with [[Neural Networks]] to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
3. **Policy Gradient Methods**:
   - Directly optimize the policy $\pi(a|s)$ using gradient descent (e.g., REINFORCE).
4. **Actor-Critic Methods**:
   - Combine value-based and policy-based methods, with an actor for actions and a critic for value estimation.
5. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
   - A state-of-the-art policy optimization method balancing exploration and stability.

## Applications

1. **Gaming**:
   - Training AI agents to play games like chess, Go, or video games (e.g., AlphaGo, OpenAI Five).
2. **Robotics**:
   - Enabling robots to learn tasks like object manipulation or navigation.
3. **Autonomous Vehicles**:
   - Teaching self-driving cars to make decisions in complex environments.
4. **Finance**:
   - Portfolio optimization and trading strategies.
5. **Healthcare**:
   - Optimizing treatment plans or resource allocation.

## Challenges

1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - Balancing the need to explore new strategies and exploit known ones.
2. **Sample Efficiency**:
   - RL often requires a large number of interactions with the environment.
3. **Reward Design**:
   - Crafting the reward function to guide the agent effectively without unintended behaviors.
4. **Stability and Convergence**:
   - RL training can be unstable, especially in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces.
