# KeyBERT
## Overview

**KeyBERT** is a simple and powerful keyword extraction method based on [[BERT]]. It generates keywords and key phrases by leveraging BERT embeddings to measure the semantic similarity between a document and its potential keywords. Unlike traditional keyword extraction methods, KeyBERT directly captures the contextual meaning of words and phrases.

KeyBERT is particularly useful for summarization, topic extraction, and improving search engine indexing.

## Key Concepts

### How KeyBERT Works
1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Uses a pretrained BERT model to generate embeddings for the document and its candidate keywords.
2. **Candidate Keyword Selection**:
   - Extracts individual words, bigrams, or n-grams from the document using methods like n-gram tokenization.
3. **Semantic Similarity**:
   - Computes the cosine similarity between the document's embedding and the embeddings of candidate keywords.
4. **Ranking**:
   - Ranks the candidates based on their similarity scores and selects the top-ranked keywords.

## Features

1. **Contextual Keyword Extraction**:
   - Extracts keywords that capture the contextual meaning of the document rather than just frequency-based importance.
2. **Flexibility**:
   - Allows customization of embedding models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, SBERT).
3. **Phrase Extraction**:
   - Supports the extraction of multi-word key phrases in addition to single keywords.

## Advantages

1. **Semantic Relevance**:
   - Extracts keywords that are semantically meaningful and contextually relevant to the document.
2. **Customizable Models**:
   - Works with any transformer-based embedding model, enabling domain-specific keyword extraction.
3. **Ease of Use**:
   - Simple API for generating keywords with minimal configuration.

## Disadvantages

1. **Computationally Expensive**:
   - Embedding generation for large documents or datasets can be time-consuming.
2. **Dependency on Pretrained Models**:
   - Quality of results depends on the choice of embedding model.
3. **Requires Preprocessing**:
   - May need additional text cleaning and preprocessing for best results.

## Applications

1. **Document Summarization**:
   - Extracts the most representative keywords or phrases from a document.
2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**:
   - Identifies key terms to optimize content for search engines.
3. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Generates topic keywords for document clustering or categorization.
4. **Content Analysis**:
   - Analyzes trends and themes in large corpora of text (e.g., news articles, research papers).

## Workflow

1. **Preprocess Text**:
   - Clean and normalize the document text.
2. **Extract Candidate Keywords**:
   - Generate n-grams or single-word candidates.
3. **Generate Embeddings**:
   - Use a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to generate embeddings for the document and candidates.
4. **Compute Similarity**:
   - Calculate cosine similarity between document embeddings and candidate embeddings.
5. **Rank and Select**:
   - Rank candidates by similarity score and select the top keywords.
