## Overview
**Linear Algebra** is a branch of mathematics that deals with [[Vectors]], [[Matrices]], and [[Linear Transformations]]. It is foundational to [[Machine Learning]], [[Deep Learning]], and [[Data Science]], as it provides the tools to represent, manipulate, and analyze data in structured formats. Linear algebra underpins operations like [[Matrix Factorization]], [[Gradient Descent]], and [[Dimensionality Reduction]] methods such as [[PCA]] and [[SVD]].

In fields like [[Optimization]] and [[Neural Networks]], linear algebra is central to computing [[Model Parameters]] and propagating gradients.
