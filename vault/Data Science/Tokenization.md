## Overview
**Tokenization** is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. It is one of the first steps in [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] pipelines, enabling models to process and analyze textual data. Tokenization is crucial for tasks like [[Text Classification]], [[Sentiment Analysis]], [[Named Entity Recognition (NER)]], and [[Machine Translation]].

Modern tokenization techniques, such as subword tokenization used in models like [[BERT]] and [[GPT]], optimize for both efficiency and linguistic representation.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Types of Tokenization**
- **Word Tokenization**:
  - Splits text into individual words.
  - Example: "I love NLP" → ["I", "love", "NLP"]
- **Subword Tokenization**:
  - Breaks words into smaller units for handling rare or unknown words.
  - Example: "unbelievable" → ["un", "##believable"] (used in [[BERT]]).
- **Character Tokenization**:
  - Splits text into individual characters.
  - Example: "hello" → ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

### **2. Common Tokenization Techniques**
1. **Whitespace Tokenization**:
   - Splits text based on spaces.
   - Simple but fails for compound words, punctuation, or languages without spaces.
2. **Regex Tokenization**:
   - Uses regular expressions to define splitting rules.
   - Example: Splitting on non-alphanumeric characters.
3. **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**:
   - Merges the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords.
   - Used in models like [[GPT-2]] and [[RoBERTa]].
4. **WordPiece**:
   - Similar to BPE, but uses probabilistic splitting based on language modeling.
   - Used in [[BERT]].
5. **SentencePiece**:
   - Treats text as a stream of bytes for language-agnostic tokenization.
   - Used in [[T5]] and [[ALBERT]].

## Applications

1. **Preprocessing for NLP Tasks**:
   - Essential for converting raw text into numerical input for models.
2. **Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**:
   - Subword tokenization ensures rare words are decomposed into known tokens.
3. **Efficient Memory Usage**:
   - Reduces vocabulary size while maintaining linguistic representation.

---

## Challenges

1. **Language-Specific Rules**:
   - Tokenization strategies vary significantly between languages (e.g., English vs. Chinese).
2. **Ambiguity**:
   - Token boundaries may differ based on context (e.g., "New York" as one token or two).
3. **Trade-Offs**:
   - Fine-grained tokenization (e.g., characters) increases sequence length and computational cost.

## Example

### Word Tokenization
Input: "Machine learning is amazing."
Output: ["Machine", "learning", "is", "amazing"]

### Subword Tokenization (WordPiece)
Input: "unbelievably"
Output: ["un", "##believable", "##ly"]
