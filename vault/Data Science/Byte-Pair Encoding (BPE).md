## Overview
**Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** is a subword tokenization technique used in [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] to break text into smaller units for efficient representation. It combines the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords iteratively to create a vocabulary of subword units. BPE is widely used in [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]] like [[GPT]] and [[RoBERTa]].

BPE addresses the limitations of [[Word Tokenization]] and [[Character Tokenization]] by balancing vocabulary size and sequence length, making it suitable for handling rare and unknown words effectively.

## Key Concepts

### **1. How BPE Works**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Treat each character in the input text as an individual token.
   - Example: "unbelievable" → ["u", "n", "b", "e", "l", "i", "e", "v", "a", "b", "l", "e"]
2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Count the frequency of all adjacent token pairs.
   - Example: ("u", "n"), ("b", "e"), ("e", "l").
3. **Merge the Most Frequent Pair**:
   - Replace the most frequent pair with a new subword token.
   - Example: ("u", "n") → "un".
4. **Repeat**:
   - Continue merging the most frequent pairs until the desired vocabulary size is reached.
   - Final Output: ["un", "believable"]

### **2. Advantages**
1. **Handles Rare Words**:
   - Decomposes unknown words into smaller, meaningful subwords.
   - Example: "unbelievably" → ["un", "believable", "ly"].
2. **Smaller Vocabulary**:
   - Reduces the number of unique tokens, making the model more memory efficient.
3. **Language-Agnostic**:
   - Works for languages with complex morphology, such as German or Finnish.

---

### **3. Disadvantages**
1. **Loss of Interpretability**:
   - Subwords may lack standalone meaning (e.g., "##ly").
2. **Increased Sequence Length**:
   - Long or complex words result in longer token sequences.
3. **Frequency Dependence**:
   - Rare meaningful subword pairs may not be merged due to low frequency.

## Applications

1. **Transformer Models**:
   - Used in [[GPT]], [[GPT-2]], and [[RoBERTa]] to tokenize input text.
2. **Machine Translation**:
   - Handles morphologically rich languages with many word forms.
3. **Text Generation**:
   - Breaks down unknown words during inference for coherent outputs.

## Example

### Step-by-Step BPE Example
Input Text: "unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable"
1. **Initial Tokens**:
   ["u", "n", "b", "e", "l", "i", "e", "v", "a", "b", "l", "e"]
2. **Frequency Count**:
   - ("u", "n"): 3
   - ("n", "b"): 3
   - ("b", "e"): 3
   - ...
3. **First Merge**:
   - Most frequent: ("u", "n") → "un"
   - Output: ["un", "b", "e", "l", "i", "e", "v", "a", "b", "l", "e"]
4. **Next Merge**:
   - Most frequent: ("b", "e") → "be"
   - Output: ["un", "be", "l", "i", "e", "v", "a", "b", "l", "e"]
5. **Final Tokens**:
   - ["un", "believable"]
