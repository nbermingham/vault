## Overview
A **Hidden Layer** is a layer in a [[Neural Network]] that lies between the input layer and the output layer. It processes inputs received from the previous layer by applying a linear transformation followed by a non-linear [[Activation Function]]. Hidden layers are responsible for capturing and learning complex patterns in the data, enabling the network to model non-linear relationships.

Hidden layers are a critical component of [[Deep Learning]] architectures, with the depth of a network (i.e., the number of hidden layers) defining its complexity.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Role in Neural Networks**
- Hidden layers extract features and transform the input data into representations that are more useful for the task at hand.
- Each neuron in a hidden layer applies:
  $$
  z = W \cdot x + b
  $$
  $$
  a = f(z)
  $$
  Where:
  - $x$: Input from the previous layer.
  - $W$: Weights associated with the connections.
  - $b$: Bias term.
  - $f$: [[Activation Function]] (e.g., [[ReLU]], [[Sigmoid]]).
  - $a$: Output of the neuron.

### **2. Non-Linearity**
- Hidden layers introduce non-linearity via activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex, non-linear mappings between inputs and outputs.
- Without non-linearity, the entire network would behave like a single linear function, regardless of the number of layers.

---

### **3. Depth and Complexity**
- **Shallow Networks**:
  - Contain fewer hidden layers.
  - Suitable for simple tasks like [[Linear Regression]] or [[Logistic Regression]].
- **Deep Networks**:
  - Contain many hidden layers.
  - Excel at complex tasks like image recognition, [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]], and [[Speech Recognition]].

## Applications

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Hidden layers learn hierarchical feature representations, from simple to complex.
   - Example: Edges in images in lower layers; objects in higher layers in a [[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)]].
2. **Classification**:
   - Hidden layers map input features to class probabilities.
3. **Regression**:
   - Predict continuous outputs by transforming inputs in hidden layers.

## Common Challenges

1. **Overfitting**:
   - Networks with too many hidden layers or neurons may overfit the training data.
   - Solutions: [[Regularization]], [[Dropout]], or reducing network complexity.
2. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**:
   - Gradients can diminish in deep networks, making it hard to train lower layers.
   - Solutions: Use [[ReLU]] activations or initialize weights carefully.
3. **Exploding Gradients**:
   - Gradients can grow too large, destabilizing training.
   - Solutions: Gradient clipping or better initialization techniques.
