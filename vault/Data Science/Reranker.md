## Overview
A **Reranker** is a secondary model in an information retrieval or search pipeline that refines and reorders a set of candidate results generated by a primary retrieval model. Rerankers are often used to improve the quality of ranked results by considering richer features, contextual embeddings, or complex relationships that the initial retrieval method (e.g., [[BM25]] or [[sparse retrieval]]) might not capture.

Rerankers are widely employed in [[Natural Language Processing]], [[Information Retrieval]], and recommendation systems.

## Key Concepts

### Retrieval vs. Reranking
1. **Retrieval**:
   - The first stage fetches a broad set of candidates using lightweight algorithms like BM25 or dense vector retrieval.
   - Prioritizes speed and scalability.

2. **Reranking**:
   - The second stage refines the ranking of these candidates by applying more computationally intensive models such as [[BERT]], [[SBERT]], or neural architectures.
   - Focuses on precision and relevance of the top results.

### Features Considered by Rerankers
- [[Semantic similarity]] (e.g., using contextual embeddings).
- Query-document relevance scores.
- Metadata or user-specific features.
- Interaction between query terms and document terms.

## Types of Rerankers

### 1. [[Pointwise Reranker]]
- Predicts the relevance score of each candidate independently.
- Example:
  - Score each document with a model and sort them by relevance.

### 2. [[Pairwise Reranker]]
- Compares pairs of candidates to decide which one is more relevant.
- Example:
  - Models trained on ranking loss functions like RankNet or LambdaRank.

### 3. [[Listwise Reranker]]
- Optimizes the order of the entire list of candidates simultaneously.
- Example:
  - Models trained with loss functions such as ListMLE or NDCG-based objectives.

## Common Architectures

### 1. [[BERT-based Rerankers]]
- Fine-tune pretrained [[BERT]] or [[SBERT]] models for ranking tasks.
- Inputs: Query and document pairs.
- Output: Relevance scores.

### 2. [[Cross-encoders]]
- Use a single transformer model to process both the query and the document together.
- Provide high precision but are computationally expensive.

### 3. [[Bi-encoders]]
- Independently encode the query and documents using a shared model.
- Provide faster inference but may sacrifice some precision compared to cross-encoders.

### 4. [[Rerankers with GNNs]]
- Use [[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)]] to model interactions between candidates in graph-based data.

## Advantages

1. **Improved Relevance**:
   - Enhances the quality of top results by focusing on fine-grained relationships between queries and candidates.
2. **Flexibility**:
   - Can incorporate complex features and embeddings that are infeasible for initial retrieval.
3. **Integration with Pretrained Models**:
   - Leverages models like BERT for contextual understanding.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Computational Cost**:
   - Rerankers are often slower due to their complexity, especially in cross-encoder setups.
2. **Limited Scalability**:
   - Only practical when reranking a small number of candidates (e.g., top 100).
3. **Dependence on Retrieval Stage**:
   - Effectiveness depends on the quality of the initial candidate set.

---

## Applications

1. **[[Search Engines]]**:
   - Refine query-document rankings to improve search result relevance.
2. **[[Question Answering]]**:
   - Rerank passages retrieved for a query to identify the most relevant ones.
3. **[[Recommendation Systems]]**:
   - Rerank recommended items based on user preferences and context.
4. **[[Conversational AI]]**:
   - Rerank candidate responses in dialogue systems.

---

## Workflow

1. **Retrieve Candidates**:
   - Use a retrieval algorithm (e.g., BM25 or dense vector retrieval) to fetch an initial set of candidates.
2. **Compute Features**:
   - Generate features for each query-candidate pair using embeddings or metadata.
3. **Apply Reranker**:
   - Use a neural model (e.g., BERT, SBERT) or a gradient-boosted model to rerank the candidates.
4. **Return Results**:
   - Sort candidates by reranking scores and return the top-ranked results.

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**:
   - Evaluates the quality of rankings with relevance scores.
2. **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**:
   - Focuses on the position of the first relevant result.
3. **Precision@K**:
   - Measures the proportion of relevant items in the top \( K \) results.
