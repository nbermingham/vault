## Overview
**Physics** is a branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter, energy, space, and time. It seeks to explain the fundamental principles governing the universe through observation, experimentation, and mathematical modeling. Physics spans a wide range of topics, from the behavior of subatomic particles to the motion of galaxies.

Modern physics integrates knowledge from [[Mathematics for Data Science|Math]], [[Engineering]], and computer science, often leveraging tools like [[Machine Learning]] to analyze complex systems and data.
