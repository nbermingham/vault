## Overview
**MLOps** (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies designed to integrate [[Machine Learning]] into modern software development and deployment workflows, aligning it with the principles of [[DevOps]]. It ensures the continuous development, deployment, monitoring, and scaling of machine learning models in production environments.

MLOps addresses the unique challenges of deploying ML models, such as versioning, reproducibility, and monitoring of models and data.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Core Components**
1. **Version Control**:
   - Tracks changes in code, datasets, and models.
   - Tools: [[Git]], [[DVC]], [[MLflow]].
2. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - Automates model training and testing pipelines using CI/CD principles.
   - Tools: [[Kubeflow]], [[TensorFlow Extended (TFX)]].
3. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploys models as scalable services (e.g., REST APIs, batch pipelines).
   - Tools: [[Docker]], [[Kubernetes]], [[Seldon Core]].
4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Tracks model performance, data drift, and operational metrics.
   - Tools: [[Prometheus]], [[Grafana]], [[ML Monitoring]] frameworks.

### **2. CI/CD for Machine Learning**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - Automates testing of ML pipelines, including data preprocessing and model validation.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**:
  - Automates the deployment of retrained models to production.

### **3. Key Challenges**
1. **Reproducibility**:
   - Ensuring models can be retrained with the same results.
   - Solution: Versioning of data, code, and configurations.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Managing training and inference workloads for large datasets.
   - Solution: Distributed systems (e.g., [[Kubernetes]], [[Spark]]).
3. **Monitoring**:
   - Detecting data drift, concept drift, and performance degradation over time.
   - Solution: Real-time monitoring tools and alerts.
4. **Collaboration**:
   - Aligning data scientists, engineers, and DevOps teams.
   - Solution: Unified tools and workflows.
