## Overview
**TensorFlow** is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building, training, and deploying machine learning and deep learning models at scale. TensorFlow supports a variety of tasks, including [[Neural Networks]], [[Gradient Descent]] optimization, and [[Deep Learning]] research, and is widely used in both academic and industrial settings.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Tensor Operations**
- **Tensors** are the core data structures in TensorFlow, representing multi-dimensional arrays.
- TensorFlow efficiently performs mathematical operations on tensors, such as matrix multiplication and element-wise operations, using its computation graph.

### **2. Computation Graph**
- TensorFlow builds a computation graph where nodes represent operations, and edges represent data (tensors).
- This enables efficient execution, parallelization, and deployment on GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs.

### **3. Automatic Differentiation**
- TensorFlow’s **Autograd** system computes gradients for optimization tasks like [[Gradient Descent]], enabling seamless model training.
