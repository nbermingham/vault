## Overview
**Overfitting** occurs when a [[Machine Learning]] model learns the training data too well, including its noise and irrelevant patterns, at the expense of generalizing to unseen data. While the model performs exceptionally on the training set, it often fails to perform well on validation or test data.

Overfitting is a key issue in [[Supervised Learning]] and is closely related to the [[Bias-Variance Tradeoff]].

## Key Concepts

### Indicators of Overfitting
1. **Low Training Error, High Test Error**:
   - The model fits the training data perfectly but fails to generalize.
2. **High Variance**:
   - The modelâ€™s predictions vary significantly across different subsets of data.
3. **Complex Models**:
   - Overly complex models (e.g., deep neural networks without regularization) are more prone to overfitting.

### Causes
1. **High Model Complexity**:
   - Too many parameters relative to the amount of data (e.g., deep networks or high-degree polynomials).
2. **Insufficient Training Data**:
   - A small dataset makes the model prone to learning noise.
3. **Noisy Data**:
   - Irrelevant features or mislabeled data can lead the model to capture noise.
4. **Lack of Regularization**:
   - Regularization techniques like [[Ridge Regression]] or [[Lasso Regression]] help prevent overfitting.

## Examples

### Polynomial Regression
- Fitting a high-degree polynomial to a simple dataset often results in a curve that passes through all points but fails to generalize:
  - Training error: Nearly zero.
  - Test error: Extremely high.

### Decision Trees
- A [[Decision Tree]] that grows to its full depth may memorize the training data, leading to overfitting.

## Techniques to Prevent Overfitting

### 1. Regularization
- Penalizes large model coefficients to reduce complexity.
- Examples:
  - **[[Ridge Regression]]** ($L2$ regularization).
  - **[[Lasso Regression]]** ($L1$ regularization).

### 2. Increase Training Data
- Adding more training examples reduces the likelihood of learning noise.

### 3. Feature Selection
- Remove irrelevant or redundant features to improve generalization.

### 4. Cross-Validation
- Use techniques like [[K-Fold Cross-Validation]] to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

### 5. Early Stopping
- In [[Deep Learning]], stop training when validation error stops decreasing.

### 6. Ensemble Methods
- Techniques like [[Bagging]] and [[Boosting]] reduce overfitting by combining multiple models.

### 7. Dropout
- Randomly deactivating neurons during training in [[Neural Networks]] to prevent reliance on specific nodes.

## Applications

1. **Model Training**:
   - Identifying and mitigating overfitting is critical during model development.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Balancing complexity during the tuning process helps avoid overfitting.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**:
   - Overfitting is a common issue in domains with small datasets, such as [[Healthcare]] or [[Finance]].
