## Overview

**Sparse Attention** is an optimization technique for reducing the computational complexity of the [[Attention Mechanism]] in [[Neural Networks]], particularly in models like [[Transformers]]. Instead of computing attention scores for all pairs of tokens in the input sequence (as in [[Full Attention]]), Sparse Attention focuses only on a subset of relevant token pairs. This significantly reduces memory and computational requirements, making it more efficient for handling long sequences.

Sparse Attention is widely used in scaling models for tasks like [[Natural Language Processing]], [[Speech Recognition]], and [[Computer Vision]].

## Key Concepts

### **1. Attention Mechanism**
- In [[Full Attention]], the complexity is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length. Sparse Attention reduces this by computing attention scores only for selected token pairs.
- Sparse patterns determine which token pairs are considered, balancing efficiency and performance.

### **2. Sparse Patterns**
Common sparsity patterns include:
- **Fixed Patterns**:
  - Predefined, like attending only to neighboring tokens in a sequence (local attention).
- **Learned Patterns**:
  - Patterns learned during training to focus on the most important token relationships.
- **Block Sparse Attention**:
  - Divides the sequence into blocks, applying attention within and between specific blocks.
- **Random Sparse Attention**:
  - Attends to randomly selected token pairs.

### **3. Computational Efficiency**
- Sparse Attention reduces the computational complexity to $O(n \cdot k)$, where $k$ is the number of attended tokens per query token.
- This makes it feasible to process very long sequences that are computationally prohibitive in [[Full Attention]].

## Techniques and Architectures

### **1. Longformer**
- Introduces sliding window attention combined with global attention to achieve sparsity.
- Used for processing very long sequences in [[NLP]] tasks like document classification.

### **2. BigBird**
- Combines local, global, and random attention patterns to ensure efficient and scalable attention.

### **3. Sparse Transformer**
- Implements learned sparsity patterns to reduce computational load while maintaining performance.

### **4. Performer**
- Utilizes kernelized approximations for attention, a variant of Sparse Attention that reduces complexity further.

## Advantages

1. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Significantly reduces memory and computational requirements compared to [[Full Attention]].
   
2. **Scalability**:
   - Enables training and inference on very long sequences, such as entire documents or long time-series data.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Different sparsity patterns allow customization for specific tasks, improving efficiency without a large performance tradeoff.

## Disadvantages

1. **Potential Information Loss**:
   - Some token relationships may be ignored due to sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring global context.

2. **Complexity in Implementation**:
   - Sparse Attention often requires custom implementations and is harder to generalize compared to [[Full Attention]].

3. **Model-Specific Patterns**:
   - Requires tuning sparsity patterns for specific tasks and architectures, increasing development time.
