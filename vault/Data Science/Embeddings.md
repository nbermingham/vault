## Overview
An **embedding** is a learned representation of data in a lower-dimensional space. It is commonly used in [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) and [[Machine Learning]] to map high-dimensional data (e.g., words, images) into dense vector spaces that capture semantic or structural relationships.

## Key Concepts

### Dense Vectors
- Embeddings are represented as dense vectors, meaning they are compact numerical representations (e.g., a 300-dimensional vector for a word).
- Dense vectors are preferred over sparse representations because they are computationally efficient and capture relationships between entities.

### Semantic Similarity
- Similar entities (e.g., words, sentences) have embeddings that are close to each other in the vector space.
- Distance metrics like [[Cosine Similarity]] or [[Euclidean Distance]] are used to measure similarity.

### Dimensionality Reduction
- Embeddings reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving its structure.
- Useful for high-dimensional data such as text, images, or graphs.

## Types of Embeddings

### Word Embeddings
- Represent words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words have similar representations.
- Examples:
  - [[Word2Vec]]: Uses Skip-Gram or CBOW models to learn word embeddings.
  - [[GloVe]]: Learns word vectors by factorizing word co-occurrence matrices.
  - [[FastText]]: Enhances word embeddings by using subword information.

### Sentence Embeddings
- Represent entire sentences or phrases in a vector space.
- Examples:
  - [[Sentence-BERT]]: Adapts BERT for generating sentence-level embeddings.
  - [[Universal Sentence Encoder]]: Designed for semantic similarity tasks.

### Document Embeddings
- Represent entire documents in vector form.
- Example:
  - Doc2Vec: An extension of Word2Vec for documents.

### Learned Embeddings
- Generated as part of model training in supervised learning.
- Example:
  - Embedding layers in [[Neural Networks]] for text [[Classification]] or image recognition.

### Graph Embeddings
- Represent nodes, edges, or entire graphs in a vector space.
- Example:
  - Node2Vec: Embeds graph nodes based on random walks.

## Applications

### [[Natural Language Processing]]
- Sentiment Analysis: Represent text for downstream [[Classification]] tasks.
- Machine Translation: Generate embeddings for cross-language mappings.
- Text Similarity: Measure similarity between words, sentences, or documents.

### Recommendation Systems
- Represent users and items in a shared vector space for personalized recommendations.

### Computer Vision
- Represent images as embeddings for image [[Classification]], object detection, or retrieval.

### Search and Information Retrieval
- Generate embeddings for queries and documents to improve search relevance.

## Methods for Learning Embeddings

### Word2Vec
- Skip-Gram: Predicts context words given a target word.
- CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words): Predicts a target word given context words.

### GloVe (Global Vectors)
- Factorizes a word co-occurrence matrix to learn embeddings.

### Transformer-Based Models
- Models like [[BERT]] and [[GPT]] generate contextual embeddings for words and sentences.

### Matrix Factorization
- Decomposes matrices (e.g., user-item interactions) into latent factors.

## Properties of Good Embeddings
1. **Semantic Meaning**: Encodes meaningful relationships.
2. **Compactness**: Efficient representation in low-dimensional space.
3. **Transferability**: Works well across tasks.
4. **Interpretability**: Can capture domain-specific nuances.

## Challenges
- **Dimensionality Choice**: Deciding the optimal embedding size.
- **Context Sensitivity**: Some embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) are static and do not account for polysemy.
- **Training Complexity**: Training embeddings requires large datasets and computational resources.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**:
  - Gensim: Library for Word2Vec, GloVe, and Doc2Vec.
  - Hugging Face Transformers: Pre-trained models for contextual embeddings.
  - TensorFlow and PyTorch: Support custom embedding layers.
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - TensorBoard: Visualize embeddings in 2D or 3D.
