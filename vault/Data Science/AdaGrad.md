## Overview
**AdaGrad** (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm) is an optimization algorithm designed to adapt the learning rate for each parameter individually based on the magnitude of past gradients. By scaling the learning rate inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of historical squared gradients, AdaGrad ensures larger updates for infrequently updated parameters and smaller updates for frequently updated ones. It is especially useful for sparse data and [[Natural Language Processing]] tasks.

## Key Concepts

### **1. How AdaGrad Works**
- AdaGrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the history of gradients:
  $$
  \theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} \cdot \nabla J(\theta)
  $$
  Where:
  - $\theta_t$: Model parameters at iteration $t$.
  - $\eta$: Global learning rate.
  - $G_t$: Accumulated sum of squared gradients:
    $$
    G_t = \sum_{i=1}^t (\nabla J(\theta))^2
    $$
  - $\epsilon$: Small constant to avoid division by zero.
  - $\nabla J(\theta)$: Gradient of the loss function.

### **2. Adaptive Learning Rate**
- Parameters with larger cumulative gradients receive smaller learning rates.
- Parameters with smaller cumulative gradients receive larger learning rates.

## Features

1. **Per-Parameter Learning Rate**:
   - Each parameter has its own dynamically adjusted learning rate.
2. **Focus on Sparse Features**:
   - Larger updates are applied to rarely updated parameters, making it effective for sparse datasets.
3. **No Manual Learning Rate Decay**:
   - Automatically reduces the learning rate as training progresses.

---

## Applications

1. **Sparse Data**:
   - Effective for datasets with sparse features, such as text in [[NLP]] or click-through-rate prediction.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Training word embeddings like [[Word2Vec]] or [[GloVe]].
3. **Recommender Systems**:
   - Useful for handling high-dimensional sparse feature spaces.

## Advantages

1. **Automatic Scaling**:
   - Adapts the learning rate dynamically, reducing the need for manual tuning.
2. **Sparse Data Optimization**:
   - Performs well in scenarios with infrequent parameter updates.
3. **Stability**:
   - Reduces learning rates progressively, stabilizing updates.

## Disadvantages

1. **Learning Rate Decay**:
   - Accumulated squared gradients can cause the learning rate to decay too quickly, leading to convergence issues.
   - **Solution**: Variants like [[RMSProp]] address this issue by introducing exponential decay.
2. **Poor Performance on Dense Data**:
   - Less effective when gradients are consistently large across parameters.

---

## Workflow

1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   - Start with randomly initialized weights $\theta$ and $G_0 = 0$.
2. **Compute Gradient**:
   - Calculate $\nabla J(\theta)$ for the current parameters.
3. **Update Accumulated Gradients**:
   - Add the squared gradients to $G_t$.
4. **Update Parameters**:
   - Adjust $\theta$ using the AdaGrad update rule.
5. **Repeat**:
   - Iterate until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.
