## Overview
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data. It encompasses a wide range of methods, tools, and frameworks for data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and decision-making.

## Key Areas
- [[Machine Learning]]: Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques.
- [[Data Engineering]]: Data pipelines, ETL processes, and storage solutions.
- [[Data Visualization]]: Techniques and tools for visual storytelling and exploration.
- [[Statistics]] and [[Probability]]: Foundations for inference and modeling.
- [[Big Data]]: Handling large-scale datasets and distributed computing.

## Special Topics
- [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]]: Cutting-edge NLP models and applications.
- [[Time Series Analysis]]: Methods for analyzing temporal data.
- [[Bayesian Inference]]: Probabilistic reasoning and applications.
- [[Survival Analysis]]: Models for time-to-event data.

## Tools and Libraries
- [[Python]]: Core libraries like NumPy, Pandas, [[Scikit-learn]], and PyTorch.
- [[R]]: Statistical computing and visualization.
