# Euclid

**Euclid** (c. 300 BCE) was a Greek mathematician often referred to as the "Father of Geometry." His work, particularly the monumental treatise *[[Elements]]*, laid the foundation for modern geometry and influenced mathematics for over two millennia.

## Key Contributions
- **The Elements**:
  - A comprehensive compilation of geometric knowledge up to his time.
  - Organized into 13 books, covering topics such as:
    - **[[Plane geometry]]** (Books 1–6).
    - **[[Number theory]]** (Books 7–9).
    - **[[Solid geometry]]** (Books 11–13).
  - Introduced axiomatic reasoning with clear definitions, postulates, and logical proofs. See [[Axiomatic System]].
  - Notable concepts include:
    - [[Euclid's Fifth Postulate]] (parallel postulate).
    - Proof of the [[Pythagorean Theorem]].

- **Axiomatic System**:
  - Defined basic terms (e.g., point, line) and built geometry systematically.
  - Inspired later developments in logic and mathematics.

- **Geometric Proofs**:
  - Emphasized rigorous logical deduction.
  - Examples include constructing geometric shapes and proving properties of angles and triangles.

## Historical Impact
- Euclid's *[[Elements]]* became the primary textbook for teaching geometry for over 2,000 years.
- His methods influenced philosophers like [[Aristotle]] and mathematicians such as [[Archimedes]] and [[Isaac Newton]].

## Legacy
- **Geometry**: Established the field of [[Euclidean Geometry]], which remains fundamental in mathematics.
- **Inspiration for Non-Euclidean Geometry**: The exploration of alternatives to [[Euclid's Fifth Postulate]] led to the development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in the 19th century.
- **Logical Framework**: Euclid's approach to reasoning and proof shaped scientific and philosophical thought.

## Key Works
- *[[Elements]]*: A foundational text in geometry and mathematics.
- Lost works attributed to Euclid include:
  - *Data*: Focused on the nature of geometric solutions.
  - *Optics*: A study of visual perception using geometry.
