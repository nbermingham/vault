## Overview
**Pre-Training** is a foundational step in training [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]] and other machine learning models. It involves training a model on a large, general-purpose dataset in a self-supervised or unsupervised manner, allowing the model to learn broad representations of the data. These representations are later fine-tuned for specific tasks, making pre-training a crucial part of [[Transfer Learning]] in modern [[Deep Learning]] workflows.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Self-Supervised Learning**
- Pre-training typically uses unlabeled data and a self-supervised learning objective, where the model learns to predict parts of the input based on other parts.
- Examples:
  - **Causal Language Modeling**: Predict the next word in a sequence (e.g., [[GPT]]).
  - **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: Predict masked tokens in the input (e.g., [[BERT]]).
  - **Span Corruption**: Predict corrupted spans of text (e.g., [[T5]]).

### **2. Representational Learning**
- During pre-training, the model learns general patterns, structures, and relationships in the data.
- These representations can be transferred to new tasks via [[Fine-Tuning]] or prompting.

### **3. Pre-Training Objectives**
- Different models use different objectives to pre-train:
  - **Next Token Prediction**: Predict the next token in a sequence (e.g., GPT).
  - **Masked Token Prediction**: Predict masked tokens (e.g., BERT).
  - **Sequence-to-Sequence Objectives**: Predict target sequences from input sequences (e.g., T5).

## Applications

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Pre-trained models like [[BERT]], [[GPT]], and [[T5]] dominate tasks like [[Text Generation]], [[Sentiment Analysis]], and [[Machine Translation]].
2. **Vision**:
   - Models like [[Vision Transformers (ViT)]] are pre-trained on large-scale image datasets.
3. **Speech**:
   - Pre-training is common in models like Wav2Vec for [[Speech Recognition]].
4. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Pre-trained models can bootstrap policy learning for complex environments.

## Workflow

1. **Dataset Collection**:
   - Large, diverse datasets (e.g., Common Crawl for NLP, ImageNet for vision).
2. **Unsupervised/Self-Supervised Objective**:
   - Define a task where labels are derived automatically from the data (e.g., predict missing tokens).
3. **Training**:
   - Train on distributed hardware using [[Transformers]] or similar architectures.
4. **Fine-Tuning or Deployment**:
   - Apply pre-trained representations to specific tasks.

## Advantages

1. **Reduces Label Dependency**:
   - Pre-training does not require labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect.
2. **Transferability**:
   - Models trained on general data can be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks.
3. **Accelerated Learning**:
   - Reduces training time and resources for downstream tasks.

## Disadvantages

1. **High Computational Cost**:
   - Requires significant computational resources for large-scale pre-training.
2. **Biases from Data**:
   - Pre-trained models can inherit biases from their training datasets.
3. **Task Mismatch**:
   - Pre-trained representations may not always align with specific downstream tasks.
