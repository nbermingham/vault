## Overview
**"Attention Is All You Need"** is a groundbreaking research paper by Vaswani et al. (2017) that introduced the [[Transformers]] architecture. This paper revolutionized [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) by replacing traditional [[Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)]] with a self-attention-based architecture. Transformers are now the backbone of modern language models like [[BERT]], [[GPT]], and [[T5]].

## Key Contributions

### 1. [[Transformers]] Architecture
- The paper introduced a novel architecture based entirely on the [[Self-Attention]] mechanism, removing the need for recurrence or convolution.
- Transformers enable parallelization during training, significantly improving efficiency and scalability.

### 2. [[Self-Attention]] Mechanism
- The model uses **self-attention** to compute relationships between all tokens in an input sequence.
- Attention weights are calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
  $$
  - $Q, K, V$: Query, Key, and Value vectors derived from the input.
  - $d_k$: Dimensionality of the key vector (scaling factor).

### 3. Positional Encoding
- Since Transformers lack inherent sequence-order awareness, [[Positional Encoding]] is added to input embeddings to provide token position information.

### 4. Multi-Head Attention
- Splits the attention mechanism into multiple heads to capture different types of relationships between tokens:
  $$
  \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_h)W^O
  $$
- Each head processes a different part of the input in parallel, enriching the model's ability to learn.

### 5. [[Feedforward Layers]]
- Fully connected feedforward layers are applied after the attention layers:
$$
  \text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
$$

### 6. [[Encoder-Decoder Architecture]]
- The Transformer consists of:
  - **Encoder**:
    - Processes the input sequence to produce a context-aware representation.
    - Includes self-attention and feedforward layers.
  - **Decoder**:
    - Generates the output sequence while attending to the encoder's output.
    - Includes self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feedforward layers.

## Advantages of Transformers

1. **[[Parallelization]]**:
   - Unlike RNNs, Transformers process all tokens in a sequence simultaneously, enabling faster training.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Suitable for large datasets and massive models like [[GPT-3]].

3. **Captures Long-Range Dependencies**:
   - Attention allows the model to learn relationships across distant tokens.

4. **Modularity**:
   - Easily extensible for different tasks (e.g., [[Text Summarization]], [[Machine Translation]]).

## Limitations

1. **Quadratic Complexity**:
   - Self-attention requires \( O(n^2) \) operations for sequences of length \( n \), making it resource-intensive for long sequences.

2. **Sequence Length Constraints**:
   - The context window is limited by computational resources.

3. **Data-Hungry**:
   - Requires large amounts of data for effective training.

## Applications

1. **[[Natural Language Processing]]**:
   - [[Text Generation]], [[Question Answering]], [[Named Entity Recognition (NER)]], [[Text Classification]].
2. **[[Machine Translation]]**:
   - The original paper demonstrated superior performance on the English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks.
3. **[[Computer Vision]]**:
   - Adapted for image data in Vision Transformers (ViT).
4. **[[Speech Processing]]**:
   - Used in speech-to-text and audio synthesis.

## Key Equations

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention
$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### Positional Encoding
$$
PE(pos, 2i) = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d}}}\right)
$$
$$
PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{\frac{2i}{d}}}\right)
$$
