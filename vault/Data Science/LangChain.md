## Overview
**LangChain** is a framework designed for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on enabling interaction with external systems, such as APIs, databases, and knowledge bases, as well as creating advanced workflows that combine LLMs with retrieval, reasoning, and tool integration.

LangChain is particularly useful for developing complex pipelines for [[Question Answering]], [[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]], conversational agents, and other use cases requiring intelligent automation.

## Key Concepts

### Modular Design
LangChain's design is modular, allowing developers to pick and integrate components tailored to specific tasks:
1. **LLMs**:
   - Interfaces with language models like [[OpenAI GPT]], Hugging Face models, or custom LLMs.
2. **Prompt Templates**:
   - Manages dynamic prompts with templates that adapt to various tasks and contexts.
3. **Memory**:
   - Supports stateful conversations by maintaining context and history.
4. **Chains**:
   - Combines multiple steps into a single pipeline (e.g., retrieve → reason → generate).
5. **Agents**:
   - Allows LLMs to interact with tools, APIs, and retrieval systems dynamically.
6. **Data Augmented Generation**:
   - Enables [[RAG]] workflows by integrating external knowledge retrieval.

## Features

1. **Prompt Management**:
   - Simplifies creating and managing complex prompts with variables and context.
2. **Integration with Tools**:
   - Connects LLMs to APIs, databases, and custom tools for enhanced capabilities.
3. **Retrieval Integration**:
   - Incorporates retrieval systems like [[FAISS]], ElasticSearch, or [[Pinecone]] to augment LLM responses with factual data.
4. **Custom Workflows**:
   - Chains together multiple tasks such as data preprocessing, retrieval, reasoning, and generation.
5. **Conversation Memory**:
   - Maintains context across multiple interactions for chat-based applications.

## Key Components

### 1. Chains
- **Chains** are pipelines that connect LLMs with other components like retrievers, reasoning models, or tools.
- Example:
  - Query → Retrieve Document → Generate Answer.

### 2. Agents
- **Agents** allow LLMs to make decisions and execute tasks dynamically by interacting with tools or APIs.
- Example:
  - An agent queries an API to fetch real-time data before responding to a user.

### 3. Prompt Templates
- Templates enable dynamic and reusable prompt generation.
- Example:
  - A prompt for summarization may accept variables for the document and the desired summary length.

### 4. Memory
- Stores conversation history or context to make LLM interactions more coherent over time.
- Types:
  - **Buffer Memory**: Retains the full history of interactions.
  - **Summary Memory**: Summarizes past interactions for efficiency.

### 5. Retrieval
- Integrates retrieval mechanisms like vector databases to provide external knowledge for tasks.
- Common integrations:
  - [[FAISS]], [[Pinecone]], Weaviate, or ElasticSearch.

   - Develop intelligent, context-aware chatbots with memory and retrieval capabilities.
2. **Question Answering**:
   - Build [[RAG]]-style systems that integrate external knowledge for precise answers.
3. **Summarization**:
   - Create pipelines to summarize long texts, leveraging retrieval for context.
4. **Custom API Integration**:
   - Enable LLMs to query APIs and process the retrieved data for enhanced responses.
5. **Data Processing**:
   - Automate multi-step workflows for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.

## Workflow

1. **Define Components**:
   - Choose LLM, retriever, tools, and memory modules.
2. **Create Chains or Agents**:
   - Design workflows that combine components for the specific task.
3. **Integrate External Systems**:
