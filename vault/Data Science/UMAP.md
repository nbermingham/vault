## Overview
**UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** is a [[Dimensionality Reduction]] technique that preserves the structure of high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space. It is widely used for visualization and feature reduction in tasks such as [[Clustering]], [[Machine Learning]], and exploratory data analysis. UMAP is based on manifold learning and is faster and more scalable than [[t-SNE]].

## Key Concepts

### Manifold Learning
- UMAP assumes that high-dimensional data lies on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the higher-dimensional space.
- The algorithm seeks to preserve the topological structure of this manifold in the low-dimensional embedding.

### Distance Preservation
- Unlike [[Principal Component Analysis]] (which preserves global variance), UMAP focuses on preserving the **local structure** of data points.

### Probabilistic Framework
- UMAP models relationships between data points as fuzzy simplicial sets and optimizes the low-dimensional representation to approximate these relationships.

## How UMAP Works

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - A graph is constructed by connecting each data point to its nearest neighbors based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean).
   - Distances are converted into a probability distribution.

2. **Optimization**:
   - UMAP optimizes the embedding by minimizing the difference between the fuzzy set representations in high- and low-dimensional spaces.

3. **Low-Dimensional Embedding**:
   - Points are iteratively adjusted in the low-dimensional space to best preserve the local relationships.

## Parameters

### Key Parameters
1. **n_neighbors**:
   - Determines the size of the local neighborhood used for graph construction.
   - Higher values capture more global structure; lower values focus on local structure.

2. **min_dist**:
   - Controls how tightly UMAP packs points together in the low-dimensional space.
   - Smaller values produce more tightly packed clusters; larger values allow for more spread.

3. **metric**:
   - Defines the distance metric used to compute the nearest neighbors (e.g., Euclidean, cosine, Manhattan).

### Additional Parameters
- **n_components**:
  - Number of dimensions in the reduced space (e.g., 2D for visualization).
- **learning_rate**:
  - Controls the step size in the optimization process.

## Advantages

1. **Fast and Scalable**:
   - Handles large datasets efficiently, even with millions of data points.
2. **Preserves Local Structure**:
   - Maintains meaningful clusters in the low-dimensional space.
3. **Customizable**:
   - Offers flexibility through parameters like `n_neighbors` and `min_dist`.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Stochastic Nature**:
   - Results can vary between runs unless a random seed is set.
2. **Limited Interpretability**:
   - Low-dimensional embeddings are not directly interpretable in terms of feature contributions.
3. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Requires tuning `n_neighbors` and `min_dist` to balance global and local structure.

## Applications

1. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizes high-dimensional datasets in 2D or 3D (e.g., [[Clustering]] results, word embeddings).
2. **Feature Reduction**:
   - Reduces dimensions for downstream tasks like classification or regression.
3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifies outliers based on their position in the low-dimensional space.
4. **Bioinformatics**:
   - Used for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and other high-dimensional biological data.

| Feature               | UMAP                                    | t-SNE                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**       | Faster and more scalable               | Slower, less scalable                  |
| **Preserves Structure** | Balances local and global structure    | Focuses more on local structure        |
| **Parameter Sensitivity** | Requires parameter tuning            | Requires less tuning                   |
| **Deterministic**     | Non-deterministic                      | Non-deterministic                      |

## Example Workflow

1. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Normalize features, handle missing values, and scale data.
2. **Apply UMAP**:
   - Use UMAP to reduce dimensions (e.g., to 2D or 3D).
3. **Visualize Results**:
   - Plot the embeddings to interpret patterns or clusters.
