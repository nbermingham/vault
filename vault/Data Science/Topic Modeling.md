## Overview
**Topic Modeling** is an unsupervised [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) technique used to identify abstract topics or themes within a collection of documents. It helps uncover hidden semantic structures in large textual datasets, making it a widely used method for exploratory data analysis in text-heavy fields such as research, marketing, and journalism.

## Key Concepts

### Definition
- Topic Modeling assumes that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words.
- It represents documents probabilistically by associating them with topics and associating topics with keywords.

### Probabilistic Approach
- Models like [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)]] treat each document as a distribution of topics and each topic as a distribution of words.

## Common Topic Modeling Techniques

### 1. **[[Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)]]**
- A generative probabilistic model that represents documents as mixtures of topics.
- Each topic is a distribution over words, and each document is a distribution over topics.
- Example:
  - Topic 1: {“sports”: 0.4, “game”: 0.3, “team”: 0.2}
  - Topic 2: {“food”: 0.5, “recipe”: 0.3, “ingredients”: 0.2}

### 2. **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**
- Decomposes the document-term matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices: one for documents-to-topics and the other for topics-to-words.
- Useful for sparse, high-dimensional datasets like text.

### 3. **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**
- Uses [[Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)]] to reduce the dimensionality of the document-term matrix, uncovering latent topics.
- Captures semantic relationships between words and documents.

### 4. **Top2Vec**
- Combines [[Word Embeddings]] with clustering to identify topics.
- Generates highly interpretable and coherent topics directly from document embeddings.

## Steps in Topic Modeling

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, stopword removal, and normalization.
2. **Document-Term Matrix Creation**:
   - Represent documents as a sparse matrix where rows are documents and columns are words.
3. **Model Fitting**:
   - Apply a topic modeling algorithm (e.g., LDA, NMF) to extract topics and their word distributions.
4. **Interpretation and Validation**:
   - Evaluate topics using coherence metrics or manual inspection.

## Applications

1. **Customer Insights**:
   - Analyze customer feedback or reviews to identify recurring themes.
2. **Content Categorization**:
   - Automatically group articles, reports, or social media posts by topic.
3. **Recommender Systems**:
   - Use topic distributions to recommend content based on user preferences.
4. **Research Analysis**:
   - Extract key topics from academic papers or large text corpora.

## Advantages

1. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Does not require labeled data, making it suitable for exploratory analysis.
2. **Identifies Hidden Patterns**:
   - Captures latent structures in text data that might not be immediately obvious.
3. **Scalable**:
   - Can process large corpora with the right optimizations.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Interpretability**:
   - Topics may not always align with human understanding or real-world concepts.
2. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Performance depends on parameters like the number of topics and hyperparameters.
3. **Sparse Representation**:
   - High-dimensional document-term matrices can be memory-intensive.

## Tools and Libraries

1. **Python Libraries**:
   - **Gensim**: Implements LDA, NMF, and other topic modeling techniques.
   - **[[Scikit-learn]]**: Provides implementations of NMF and LSA.
   - **BERTopic**: Uses advanced [[Word Embeddings]] and clustering for topic modeling.
2. **Visualization Tools**:
   - **pyLDAvis**: Visualizes LDA topics and their relationships.
   - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Plots topic distributions and trends.

## Metrics for Topic Evaluation

1. **Coherence Score**:
   - Measures how interpretable topics are based on word co-occurrence.
2. **Perplexity**:
   - Evaluates how well a probabilistic model predicts unseen data.
3. **Topic Diversity**:
   - Ensures topics are distinct from one another.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Load and Preprocess Text Data**:
   - Tokenize, remove stopwords, and normalize the text.
2. **Create a Document-Term Matrix**:
   - Use [[TF-IDF]] or bag-of-words representation.
3. **Apply Topic Modeling**:
   - Use LDA, NMF, or other algorithms to extract topics.
4. **Interpret and Visualize Results**:
   - Examine top keywords for each topic and plot topic distributions.
