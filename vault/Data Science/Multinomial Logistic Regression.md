## Overview
**Multinomial Logistic Regression** is an extension of logistic regression used for multi-class classification problems where the target variable has more than two categories. It models the probability of each category as a function of the input features and generalizes the binary [[Logistic Regression]] approach to multi-class scenarios.

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Class Classification
- In multinomial logistic regression, the dependent variable \( Y \) has \( K \) possible categories: $Y \in \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$.
- The model predicts the probability of each category:
$$
P(Y = k | X) = \frac{\exp(\beta_k^\top X)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(\beta_j^\top X)}
$$
Where:
  - $X$: Input features.
  - $\beta_k$: Coefficients for category $k$.
  - $K$: Total number of classes.

---

## Assumptions
1. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)**:
   - The relative odds between any two categories are independent of the presence or absence of other categories.
   - Example: The probability of choosing between apples and bananas doesnâ€™t change with the addition of oranges.

2. **Linear Relationship**:
   - Assumes a linear relationship between the log-odds and the predictors.

3. **No Perfect Multicollinearity**:
   - Predictors should not be perfectly correlated.

---

## [[Softmax Function]]
Multinomial logistic regression uses the **[[Softmax Function]]** to compute probabilities for each category:
$$
P(Y = k | X) = \frac{\exp(\beta_k^\top X)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(\beta_j^\top X)}
$$
- The [[Softmax Function]] ensures that:
  1. Probabilities are non-negative.
  2. The sum of probabilities across all classes equals 1.

## Training the Model
1. **[[Loss Function]]**:
   - Uses the **[[Cross-Entropy Loss]]**:
   $$
   \mathcal{L} = - \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k} \log P(Y = k | X_i)
   $$
   Where:
     - \( y_{i,k} \): 1 if observation \( i \) belongs to class \( k \), else 0.
     - \( P(Y = k | X_i) \): Predicted probability of class \( k \) for observation \( i \).

2. **[[Optimization]]**:
   - Optimizes the loss function using techniques like [[Gradient Descent]] or [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]].

---

## Applications
1. **Text Classification**:
   - Categorizing emails into multiple classes (e.g., spam, promotions, social).
2. **Healthcare**:
   - Diagnosing diseases with multiple possible outcomes.
3. **Marketing**:
   - Predicting customer choices among multiple products.
4. **Image Classification**:
   - Classifying images into categories like "cat," "dog," or "bird."

---

## Advantages
1. **Simple and Interpretable**:
   - Provides clear coefficients for each predictor and class.
2. **Probabilistic Output**:
   - Predicts probabilities, which can be useful for decision-making.
3. **Versatility**:
   - Can be applied to any classification problem with multiple categories.

---

## Disadvantages
1. **Linearity Assumption**:
   - Assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds, which might not hold in practice.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Computationally expensive for large datasets or many classes.
3. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)**:
   - The IIA assumption may not hold in some real-world scenarios.

---

## Regularization
- Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients:
  - **L1 Regularization**: Encourages sparsity (some coefficients become zero).
  - **L2 Regularization**: Shrinks coefficients toward zero without making them sparse.
