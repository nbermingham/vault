# Prompt Engineering

## Overview
**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) like [[GPT]], [[BERT]], and other [[Transformers]]. It is essential for extracting high-quality outputs and tailoring LLMs for specific applications such as [[Text Generation]], [[Summarization]], or [[Machine Translation]].

## Key Concepts

### Role of Prompts
- Prompts guide LLMs by providing context, instructions, or examples that help the model generate desired responses.
- They can range from simple queries to complex task-specific templates.

### Few-Shot, Zero-Shot, and One-Shot Learning
1. **[[Zero-Shot Learning]]**:
   - No examples are provided; the model relies solely on the prompt.
   - Example:
     Translate the following English sentence to French: "How are you?"

2. **[[One-Shot Learning]]**:
   - One example is provided to guide the model.
   - Example:
     Translate the following English sentence to French. 
     English: "Hello, my friend." French: "Bonjour, mon ami."
     English: "How are you?" French:

3. **[[Few-Shot Learning]]**:
   - Several examples are included to improve the model's performance.
   - Example:
     Translate these sentences from English to French.
     English: "Hello, my friend." French: "Bonjour, mon ami."
     English: "Good morning." French: "Bon matin."
     English: "How are you?" French:

## Techniques for Effective Prompt Engineering

### [[Instruction-Based Prompts]]
- Explicitly tell the model what to do.
- Example:
  Summarize the following article in one sentence:
  "Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the tech industry..."

### [[Example-Based Prompts]]
- Provide examples to set expectations for input-output behavior.
- Example:
  Convert the following temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
  Celsius: 0, Fahrenheit: 32
  Celsius: 100, Fahrenheit: 212
  Celsius: 25, Fahrenheit:

### [[Formatting Prompts]]
- Use consistent and structured formats for input and output.
- Example:
  Task: Summarize the article.
  Input: "The global economy is facing challenges due to..."
  Output:

### [[Contextual Prompts]]
- Provide relevant background information for the task.
- Example:
  You are an expert translator. Translate the following:
  "Buenos días, ¿cómo estás?" to English.

### [[Chained Prompts]]
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps for the model to follow sequentially.
- Example:
  Step 1: Identify the main topic of the text.
  Step 2: Write a summary based on the main topic.
  Text: "The rapid advancements in AI are..."

### [[Temperature]] and [[Top-k Sampling]]
- Adjust parameters like **temperature** and **top-k/top-p** sampling to control randomness and creativity in the output.
  - **Temperature**: Lower values make outputs more deterministic; higher values add variability.
  - **[[Top-k Sampling]]**: Limits outputs to the top-k most likely tokens.

## Applications

### [[Natural Language Processing]]
- **Text Summarization**: Summarize articles, papers, or books.
- **Translation**: Translate text between languages using specific instructions.
- **Text Classification**: Categorize emails, documents, or customer feedback.

### Creative Writing
- Generate poems, stories, or screenplays with prompts designed for creativity.

### [[Data Extraction]]
- Extract structured data from unstructured text.
- Example:
  Extract the following information: Name, Age, Location.
  Text: "John is 34 years old and lives in New York."

### Education
- **Tutoring**: Generate step-by-step explanations or answers to questions.
- **Code Assistance**: Write or debug code with clear instructions.

### Chatbots and Assistants
- Design conversational prompts for natural and engaging user interactions.

## Challenges

### Ambiguity
- Vague prompts may lead to unclear or irrelevant outputs.
  - Example: "Explain AI." (Too broad)

### Length Constraints
- Models like GPT have a limited context window, so excessively long prompts may truncate inputs or outputs.

### Bias and Inappropriate Outputs
- Poorly designed prompts can unintentionally elicit biased or harmful responses.

### Task-Specific Optimization
- Designing optimal prompts for unique tasks often requires iteration and experimentation.

### Model-Specific Interfaces
- **OpenAI Playground**: Interactive tool for crafting and testing prompts with GPT.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Libraries for working with pre-trained models programmatically.
- **[[LangChain]]**: Framework for building complex, multi-step prompting workflows.

### Experimentation Techniques
- **Prompt Chaining**:
  - Break tasks into subtasks and chain multiple prompts.
- **Prompt Iteration**:
  - Test and refine prompts to improve output quality.

### APIs
- OpenAI API, Google PaLM API, or Cohere API for deploying and testing prompts at scale.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Explicit**:
   - Clearly define the task and expected output format.
2. **Test Iteratively**:
   - Experiment with different prompt styles and examples.
3. **Minimize Context**:
   - Avoid unnecessary details in the prompt to save tokens and focus the model.
4. **Guide with Examples**:
   - Use few-shot examples to improve task accuracy.
5. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Test prompts for edge cases or ambiguities to ensure robustness.
