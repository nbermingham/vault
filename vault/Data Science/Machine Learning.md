## Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on creating systems that learn and improve from data without explicit programming. It encompasses various algorithms and approaches to uncover patterns, make predictions, and automate tasks.

## Key Concepts
- [[Supervised Learning]]: Training models on labeled data to make predictions.
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]: Discovering hidden structures in unlabeled data.
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]: Optimizing actions through rewards and penalties.
- [[Feature Engineering]]: Selecting, transforming, and creating input features for better model performance.
- [[Model Evaluation]]: Techniques to measure accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more.

## Common Algorithms
- [[Linear Regression]]: Predicting continuous values.
- [[Logistic Regression]]: Binary and multi-class [[Classification]].
- [[Decision Trees]] and [[Random Forests]]: Intuitive models for [[Classification]] and regression.
- [[Neural Networks]]: Foundation of deep learning.
- [[Support Vector Machines (SVM)]]: Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**: [[Scikit-learn]], [[TensorFlow]], [[PyTorch]].
- **Frameworks**: [[Keras]], [[Hugging Face]] for NLP.
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Applications
- [[Natural Language Processing]]: Text [[Classification]], translation, and chatbots.
- [[Computer Vision]]: Image recognition, object detection, and generative models.
- [[Predictive Analytics]]: Forecasting trends and customer behavior.
- [[Healthcare]]: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery.

## Workflow
1. **Problem Definition**: Frame the ML problem (e.g., [[Classification]], regression).
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant datasets.
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and transform data.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms.
5. **Training and Tuning**: Optimize model parameters.
6. **Evaluation**: Test on unseen data to measure performance.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy models in production environments.
