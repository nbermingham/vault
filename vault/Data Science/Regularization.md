## Overview
**Regularization** is a technique used in [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]] to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function. This penalty discourages complex models by reducing the magnitude of model parameters or constraining their flexibility. Regularization ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data, balancing the tradeoff between bias and variance in the [[Bias-Variance Tradeoff]].

## Key Types of Regularization

1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:
   - Adds the sum of absolute values of the model parameters to the loss function:
     $$
     L = \text{Loss Function} + \lambda \sum |w_i|
     $$
   - Encourages sparsity by driving some weights to zero.
   - Commonly used in [[Lasso Regression]].

2. **[[Ridge Regression|L2 Regularization]] (Ridge)**:
   - Adds the sum of squared values of the model parameters to the loss function:
     $$
     L = \text{Loss Function} + \lambda \sum w_i^2
     $$
   - Reduces the magnitude of parameters without making them exactly zero.
   - Used in [[Ridge Regression]] and [[Logistic Regression]].

3. **Elastic Net**:
   - Combines L1 and L2 penalties:
     $$
     L = \text{Loss Function} + \lambda_1 \sum |w_i| + \lambda_2 \sum w_i^2
     $$
   - Balances sparsity and parameter shrinkage.

4. **Dropout**:
   - Temporarily "drops" (sets to zero) random neurons during training.
   - Prevents co-adaptation of neurons in [[Neural Networks]].

5. **Early Stopping**:
   - Halts training when the performance on a validation set stops improving.
   - Prevents overfitting caused by excessive training.

6. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Expands the training dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling) to prevent overfitting to specific patterns.

7. **Weight Decay**:
   - Equivalent to [[Ridge Regression|L2 regularization]] but applied directly to weight updates during optimization.

## Applications

1. **Regression Models**:
   - Regularization techniques like L1, L2, and Elastic Net are applied in [[Linear Regression]] and [[Logistic Regression]] to prevent overfitting.
2. **Deep Learning**:
   - Regularization methods like [[Dropout]] and [[Batch Normalization]] are used in [[Neural Networks]] to stabilize training and improve generalization.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Techniques like token-level regularization (e.g., noise injection) improve the robustness of [[Language Models]].

## Advantages

1. **Prevents Overfitting**:
   - Regularization discourages overly complex models that fit noise in the data.
2. **Improves Generalization**:
   - Ensures the model performs well on unseen data.
3. **Sparsity**:
   - L1 regularization results in sparse models, simplifying interpretation.

## Disadvantages

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Regularization introduces additional hyperparameters (e.g., $\lambda$) that require careful tuning.
2. **Underfitting Risk**:
   - Excessive regularization can oversimplify the model, leading to high bias.
3. **Increased Complexity**:
   - Regularization methods like [[Dropout]] and Elastic Net add computational overhead.
