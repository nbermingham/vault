## Overview
**Precision** is a performance metric in [[Classification]] tasks that measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive. It evaluates the quality of positive predictions and is especially useful in scenarios where minimizing false positives is critical.

Precision is often used alongside [[Recall]] and other metrics like [[F1-Score]] to assess model performance comprehensively.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Formula**
Precision is calculated as:
$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
$$
Where:
- $TP$: True Positives (correctly predicted positive instances).
- $FP$: False Positives (instances incorrectly predicted as positive).

---

### **2. Interpretation**
- **High Precision**: Most of the positive predictions are correct.
- **Low Precision**: A significant number of positive predictions are incorrect.

---

## Applications

1. **Binary Classification**:
   - Example: Spam detection, where false positives (non-spam emails flagged as spam) are undesirable.
2. **Multi-Class Classification**:
   - Precision can be calculated per class to evaluate model performance on individual categories.
3. **Imbalanced Datasets**:
   - Precision is crucial when the positive class is rare and false positives carry significant costs (e.g., fraud detection).

---

## Advantages

1. **Focus on Positive Class**:
   - Precision highlights how well the model identifies true positives relative to false positives.
2. **Useful for Specific Applications**:
   - Ideal for tasks where the cost of false positives outweighs false negatives (e.g., medical diagnosis, email filtering).

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Ignores False Negatives**:
   - Precision does not consider missed positive instances, making it insufficient on its own for imbalanced datasets.
2. **Bias Toward Rare Positives**:
   - Models predicting fewer positives can achieve high precision but may miss most actual positives.

## Comparison with Other Metrics

| **Metric**     | **Focus**               | **Use Case**                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Precision**   | Quality of positive predictions | Minimize false positives               |
| **Recall**      | Coverage of positives   | Minimize false negatives                 |
| **F1-Score**    | Balance of precision and recall | Imbalanced datasets                     |
| **Accuracy**    | Overall correctness     | Balanced datasets                        |

## Example

### Binary Classification Example
Confusion matrix:
|                  | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | $TP = 50$          | $FN = 10$          |
| **Actual Negative** | $FP = 5$           | $TN = 35$          |

**Precision Calculation**:
$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{50}{50 + 5} = 0.91
$$
This means 91% of positive predictions were correct.
