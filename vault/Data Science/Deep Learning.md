## Overview
**Deep Learning** is a subset of [[Machine Learning]] that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures) to model complex patterns and representations in data. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in various domains such as [[Computer Vision]], [[Natural Language Processing]], [[Speech Recognition]], and reinforcement learning.

Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data, enabling end-to-end learning without extensive [[Feature Engineering]].

## Key Concepts

### Neural Networks
- **[[Artificial Neural Network]] (ANN)**:
  - Composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs and propagate outputs through weighted connections.
- **[[Deep Neural Network]] (DNN)**:
  - A neural network with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers.

### [[Activation Functions]]
- Nonlinear functions applied to neuron outputs to enable learning complex patterns.
  - Examples: [[ReLU]], [[Sigmoid]], [[Tanh]], [[Softmax]].

### Forward and Backpropagation
- **[[Forward Propagation]]**:
  - Input data flows through the network to produce predictions.
- **[[Backpropagation]]**:
  - Gradients of the loss function are computed and propagated backward to update weights using optimization algorithms like [[Gradient Descent]].

### Loss Functions
- Measure the error between predicted outputs and true labels.
  - Examples: [[Cross-Entropy Loss]], [[Mean Squared Error]] (MSE), [[Hinge Loss]].

## Key Architectures

### [[Feedforward Neural Networks]]
- Data flows in one direction from input to output, without cycles.
- Used for tasks like regression and classification.

### [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] (CNNs)
- Specialized for grid-like data (e.g., images).
- Extracts spatial features using convolutional layers.

### [[Recurrent Neural Networks]] (RNNs)
- Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series, text).
- Maintains a memory of previous inputs using recurrent connections.

### [[Transformers]]
- Modern architectures like [[BERT]], [[GPT]], and [[T5]] that use [[Self-Attention]] mechanisms to process sequential data in parallel.
- State-of-the-art in [[Natural Language Processing]].

### Generative Models
- **[[Autoencoders]]**:
  - Learn efficient data representations for tasks like anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction.
- **[[GANs]] (Generative Adversarial Networks)**:
  - Generate new data (e.g., images, text) by training a generator and discriminator in competition.
- **[[VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)]]**:
  - Generate data by learning a probabilistic latent space.

   - Demands significant computational resources (e.g., [[GPUs]], [[TPUs]]).
3. **Black Box Nature**:
   - Lacks interpretability compared to traditional machine learning models.
4. **[[Overfitting]]**:
   - Risk of overfitting if the model is too complex or trained on insufficient data.

## Training Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize, scale, and augment data as needed.
2. **Model Design**:
   - Choose an architecture (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) and set hyperparameters.
3. **Training**:
   - Train the model using an optimizer (e.g., [[Adam Optimizer]]) and a loss function.
4. **Validation**:
   - Evaluate model performance on a validation set to tune hyperparameters.
5. **Testing**:
   - Test the model on unseen data to measure generalization.
