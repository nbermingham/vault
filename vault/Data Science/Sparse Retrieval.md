## Overview
**Sparse Retrieval** is a method in [[Information Retrieval]] that relies on sparse representations of text, where only a small subset of features (e.g., terms or tokens) are non-zero in the feature space. Sparse retrieval systems match queries and documents using methods like exact term matching or sparse vector models, such as [[TF-IDF]] or [[BM25]]. 

Unlike dense retrieval, which relies on dense vector embeddings, sparse retrieval emphasizes explicit term-based relevance, making it efficient and interpretable for traditional retrieval systems.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Sparse Representations**
- Text is represented in a sparse vector space where each dimension corresponds to a term in the vocabulary.
- Most dimensions are zero, with non-zero values indicating the presence or relevance of terms.

### **2. Term Matching**
- Queries and documents are matched based on shared terms and their respective weights.
- Methods like [[BM25]] and [[TF-IDF]] compute term importance to rank documents for a query.

## Methods and Models

1. **[[TF-IDF]] (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**:
   - Scores terms based on their frequency in a document relative to their frequency across the corpus.
   - Example: Terms that are frequent in a document but rare in the corpus get higher weights.

2. **[[BM25]]**:
   - An extension of TF-IDF that incorporates term saturation and document length normalization.
   - Example: Rewards documents with a high term frequency but penalizes overly long documents.

3. **Boolean Retrieval**:
   - Matches documents exactly based on query terms (e.g., AND, OR operators).

## Applications

1. **Search Engines**:
   - Sparse retrieval methods form the backbone of traditional search engines, such as Elasticsearch and Lucene.
2. **Question Answering**:
   - Finds relevant documents or passages to answer a query.
3. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Retrieves explicit matches based on user-provided keywords.
4. **Legal and Medical Search**:
   - Offers precise term-based searches in high-stakes domains.

## Advantages

1. **Efficiency**:
   - Sparse retrieval systems are computationally efficient and scale well to large corpora.
2. **Interpretability**:
   - Rankings are easy to explain due to explicit term matching.
3. **Domain Specificity**:
   - Performs well when exact term matching is critical, such as in legal or scientific domains.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Limited Context Understanding**:
   - Sparse models do not capture semantic relationships between terms.
   - Example: "car" and "vehicle" are treated as unrelated terms.
2. **Vocabulary Dependency**:
   - Requires a fixed vocabulary, making it less robust to typos or unseen terms.
3. **Inferior Performance on Ambiguous Queries**:
   - Sparse models struggle with queries requiring deeper contextual understanding.

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Representation**    | Sparse vectors (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25)   | Dense embeddings (e.g., [[BERT]])       |
| **Efficiency**        | High                                  | Moderate to High (depends on hardware)  |
| **Interpretability**  | High                                  | Low                                     |
| **Semantic Matching** | Weak                                  | Strong                                  |
