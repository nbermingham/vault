## Overview
The **Log-Loss Function** (Logarithmic Loss), also known as **Logarithmic Error** or **Cross-Entropy Loss**, is a commonly used loss function in [[Classification]] tasks, particularly for probabilistic models like [[Logistic Regression]] and [[Neural Networks]]. Log-Loss measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. It penalizes incorrect predictions with high confidence more heavily than less confident ones.

## Formula
For a binary classification problem, the Log-Loss function is defined as:
$$
\text{Log-Loss} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
$$
Where:
- $n$: Number of samples.
- $y_i$: True label for the $i^{th}$ sample ($0$ or $1$).
- $\hat{y}_i$: Predicted probability for the $i^{th}$ sample.
- $\log$: Natural logarithm.

For multi-class classification, Log-Loss generalizes to:
$$
\text{Log-Loss} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^C y_{i,j} \log(\hat{y}_{i,j})
$$
Where:
- $C$: Number of classes.
- $y_{i,j}$: True label for class $j$ for the $i^{th}$ sample (1 if correct, 0 otherwise).
- $\hat{y}_{i,j}$: Predicted probability for class $j$ for the $i^{th}$ sample.

## Interpretation
1. **Low Log-Loss**:
   - Indicates that the model's predicted probabilities are close to the true labels.
2. **High Log-Loss**:
   - Indicates that the model's predicted probabilities deviate significantly from the true labels, especially if incorrect predictions are highly confident.

## Applications

1. **Binary Classification**:
   - Tasks like spam detection, fraud detection, or sentiment analysis.
2. **Multi-Class Classification**:
   - Tasks like image recognition, document categorization, or speech recognition.
3. **[[Probabilistic Models]]**:
   - Used in models that output probabilities, ensuring the predicted probabilities align with the true labels.

## Advantages

1. **Probabilistic Interpretation**:
   - Encourages models to output well-calibrated probabilities.
2. **Differentiable**:
   - Easily optimized using methods like [[Gradient Descent]].
3. **Sensitivity to Confidence**:
   - Penalizes incorrect confident predictions more heavily, improving reliability.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Logarithms of small probabilities can lead to numerical issues.
   - **Solution**: Add a small constant $\epsilon$ to probabilities (e.g., $\log(\hat{y} + \epsilon)$).
2. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Models trained with Log-Loss may perform poorly on imbalanced datasets without adjustments (e.g., using class weights).
3. **Interpretability**:
   - Log-Loss values are not as intuitively interpretable as metrics like accuracy or [[F1-Score]].

## Example
Consider a binary classification task with the following predictions:
- **True Labels ($y$)**: [1, 0, 1, 0]
- **Predicted Probabilities ($\hat{y}$)**: [0.9, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1]

Log-Loss is calculated as:
$$
\text{Log-Loss} = -\frac{1}{4} \left[ \log(0.9) + \log(0.8) + \log(0.7) + \log(0.9) \right] \approx 0.164
$$
