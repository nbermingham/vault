## Overview
**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a framework that combines **retrieval-based** and **generation-based** approaches in [[Natural Language Processing]]. It augments the text generation process by integrating external knowledge sources, such as document databases or knowledge graphs, to improve the relevance, factual accuracy, and contextuality of generated text.

RAG is particularly effective in knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering, conversational AI, and document generation, where relying solely on the pre-trained language model's internal knowledge is insufficient.

## Key Concepts

### Components of RAG
1. **Retriever**:
   - Retrieves relevant documents or knowledge snippets from an external source based on the query.
   - Common methods:
     - **[[Sparse Retrieval]]**: Uses algorithms like BM25 or [[TF-IDF]].
     - **[[Dense Retrieval]]**: Embedding-based methods like [[DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)]], where embeddings of queries and documents are compared for similarity.

2. **Generator**:
   - A sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., [[BART]], [[T5]], or [[GPT]]) that generates responses by conditioning on the query and retrieved documents.
   - Produces coherent and relevant outputs by utilizing both retrieved knowledge and the context of the query.

3. **Retriever-Generator Interaction**:
   - Retrieved documents are concatenated with the query and passed to the generator to enhance the context for response generation.

## Workflow

1. **Input Query**:
   - A user-provided question, phrase, or text input.
2. **Retrieve Documents**:
   - The retriever fetches the most relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base or corpus.
3. **Augment Input**:
   - Combine the input query with retrieved documents to create an enriched context.
4. **Generate Output**:
   - The generator uses the augmented context to produce a response or output that is both accurate and coherent.

## Types of RAG Architectures

### 1. RAG-Sequence
- Retrieves multiple documents and generates one token at a time based on a single document.
- Each document is processed in sequence to contribute to the final output.

### 2. RAG-Token
- Generates one token at a time while considering all retrieved documents simultaneously.
- More computationally intensive but produces more accurate results in complex scenarios.

### 3. Hybrid Retrieval RAG
- Combines sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) and dense retrieval to balance precision and recall during the retrieval phase.

## Applications

1. **Open-Domain Question Answering**:
   - Retrieves knowledge from external sources to answer fact-based or open-ended questions.
   - Example: Answering questions like "What is the capital of Canada?" using external encyclopedic data.

2. **Conversational AI**:
   - Generates contextually accurate responses in chatbots or dialogue systems by retrieving relevant conversational context or external knowledge.
   - Example: Customer service bots using company FAQs.

3. **Document Generation**:
   - Augments content creation by retrieving reference materials to ensure factual accuracy.
   - Example: Creating reports or summaries with supporting documents.

4. **Fact-Checking and Verification**:
   - Retrieves supporting evidence for claims or refutes false information.
   - Example: Validating news articles or social media posts.

5. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Combines user queries with retrieval to generate personalized responses or suggestions.
   - Example: Product recommendations in e-commerce based on user preferences and retrieved reviews.

## Advantages

1. **Factual Accuracy**:
   - Integrates external knowledge to reduce hallucinations, ensuring the model generates more accurate responses.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Scales to large external knowledge bases, enabling retrieval from millions of documents.
3. **Domain Adaptability**:
   - Easily adapts to specialized domains by training or fine-tuning the retriever on domain-specific corpora.
4. **Efficient Knowledge Updates**:
   - Knowledge can be updated by modifying the retrieval database without retraining the generator.

## Disadvantages

1. **Dependency on Retriever**:
   - If the retriever fails to fetch relevant documents, the generator's output quality deteriorates.
2. **Computational Cost**:
   - Requires separate models for retrieval and generation, which can be resource-intensive.
3. **Context Length Limitations**:
   - The concatenation of multiple retrieved documents and the query may exceed token limits of some language models, reducing efficiency.
4. **Evaluation Complexity**:
   - Evaluating RAG models is challenging as it involves assessing both retrieval and generation quality.

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Retriever Metrics**:
   - **[[Recall@K]]**: Measures the fraction of relevant documents retrieved in the top $K$.
   - **[[Precision@K]]**: Evaluates the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant.

2. **Generator Metrics**:
   - **[[BLEU]], [[ROUGE]]**: Measures text similarity between generated and ground-truth outputs.
   - **[[NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)]]**: Evaluates ranking quality in retrieval tasks.

3. **Combined Metrics**:
   - **Exact Match (EM)**: Evaluates if the generated response matches the ground truth exactly.
   - **[[F1 Score]]**: Assesses the overlap between generated and true responses.
