## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to work with text and speech data.

## Key Concepts
- [[Text Preprocessing]]: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removing stop words.
- [[Embeddings]]: Representing words and sentences as numerical vectors (e.g., [[Word2Vec]], [[GloVe]], [[BERT embeddings]]).
- [[Language Models]]: Predicting sequences of text using probabilistic and deep learning methods.
- [[Named Entity Recognition (NER)]]: Extracting entities like names, dates, and locations from text.
- [[Sentiment Analysis]]: Classifying text based on emotional tone (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
- [[Machine Translation]]: Translating text between languages.

## Applications
- **Text [[Classification]]**: Categorizing emails (spam vs. not spam), classifying news articles, etc.
- **Chatbots**: Developing conversational agents for customer support.
- **Speech Recognition**: Transcribing spoken language into text.
- **Summarization**: Generating concise summaries of long documents.
- **Information Retrieval**: Search engines and question-answering systems.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**:
  - [[NLTK]]: Classic NLP library for preprocessing and linguistic analysis.
  - [[SpaCy]]: Industrial-strength NLP library for pipelines and embeddings.
  - [[Hugging Face]]: Transformers and pre-trained models for state-of-the-art NLP.
- **Other Tools**:
  - [[Gensim]]: [[Topic Modeling]] and document similarity.
  - [[TextBlob]]: Simple text processing.

## Key Techniques
- [[Tokenization]]: Breaking text into smaller units (e.g., words or subwords).
- [[Transformers]]: State-of-the-art architectures like [[BERT]] and [[GPT]].
- [[Sequence-to-Sequence Models]]: Encoder-decoder architectures for tasks like translation and summarization.
- [[Attention Mechanism]]: Weighing the importance of different words in a sequence.

## Advanced Topics
- [[Large Language Models (LLMs)]]: Cutting-edge NLP models trained on massive text datasets.
- [[Zero-shot Learning]] and [[Few-Shot Learning]]: Enabling models to generalize with minimal labeled data.
- [[Prompt Engineering]]: Crafting input prompts to optimize model output.
- [[Ethics in NLP]]: Addressing bias, fairness, and misinformation in language models.
