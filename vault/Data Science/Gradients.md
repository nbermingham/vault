## Overview
**Gradients** are a vector of first-order partial derivatives that represent the direction and rate of the steepest ascent of a scalar function. In [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]], gradients are essential for optimization tasks, such as minimizing loss functions using algorithms like [[Gradient Descent]].

For a scalar function $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, the gradient is denoted as:
$$
\nabla f = \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right]
$$

## Key Concepts

### **1. Gradient Vector**
The gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent, where the magnitude indicates the rate of change. For minimizing a function, optimization algorithms move in the opposite direction of the gradient (steepest descent).

### **2. Gradient in Multi-Dimensions**
For a function $f(x, y)$, the gradient is:
$$
\nabla f = \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right]
$$
This vector provides directional information in 2D or higher-dimensional spaces.

### **3. Relationship with Partial Derivatives**
Each component of the gradient is a partial derivative with respect to one of the input variables:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}
$$
indicates how $f$ changes as $x_i$ changes, holding all other variables constant.

## Applications

1. **[[Gradient Descent]]**:
   - Gradients guide the optimization of loss functions in [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]] by indicating the steepest descent direction.
2. **Optimization**:
   - Gradients are used to solve minimization and maximization problems.
3. **Physics**:
   - Gradients describe the rate of change of physical quantities, such as potential energy.
4. **Image Processing**:
   - Gradients detect edges by measuring intensity changes in images.

## Example

For the function:
$$
f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
$$
The gradient is:
$$
\nabla f = \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right] = [2x, 2y]
$$

At the point $(1, 1)$:
$$
\nabla f(1, 1) = [2 \cdot 1, 2 \cdot 1] = [2, 2]
$$
This indicates that the steepest ascent at $(1, 1)$ is in the direction of the vector $[2, 2]$.
