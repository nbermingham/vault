## Overview
A **Hyperplane** is a geometric concept in [[Linear Algebra]] that represents a flat affine subspace in a high-dimensional space. In an $n$-dimensional space, a hyperplane is an $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace that divides the space into two halves. Hyperplanes are widely used in [[Machine Learning]], especially in algorithms like [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]] for classification tasks.

## Key Concepts

### **1. Mathematical Representation**
A hyperplane in $n$ dimensions is defined by the equation:
$$
w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b = 0
$$
Where:
- $w = [w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n]$: The normal vector perpendicular to the hyperplane.
- $b$: The bias or intercept term.
- $x = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$: A point in the $n$-dimensional space.

The hyperplane divides the space such that:
- $w \cdot x + b > 0$: Points on one side of the hyperplane.
- $w \cdot x + b < 0$: Points on the other side.

### **2. Hyperplane in Machine Learning**
- In [[Classification]], hyperplanes are used to separate classes of data points.
- In [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]], the optimal hyperplane maximizes the margin between two classes.
- Hyperplanes generalize the concept of a line (in 2D) or a plane (in 3D) to higher dimensions.

### **3. Affine Hyperplane**
- A hyperplane is affine if it does not pass through the origin. It is defined as:
  $$
  w \cdot x + b = c
  $$
  Where $c$ is a constant offset.

## Applications

1. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**:
   - Hyperplanes separate data into different classes.
   - The optimal hyperplane maximizes the margin between support vectors.
2. **Perceptron Algorithm**:
   - A [[Linear Model]] that uses a hyperplane to classify data.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Hyperplanes can represent decision boundaries in reduced feature spaces.
4. **Geometry and Optimization**:
   - Hyperplanes are used in optimization problems to represent constraints.

## Example

Consider a 2D space with the hyperplane:
$$
2x_1 + 3x_2 - 6 = 0
$$
- The normal vector is $[2, 3]$, indicating the direction perpendicular to the hyperplane.
- Points $(x_1, x_2)$ that satisfy the equation lie on the hyperplane.
- The hyperplane divides the 2D space into two regions:
  - $2x_1 + 3x_2 - 6 > 0$: One side.
  - $2x_1 + 3x_2 - 6 < 0$: The other side.

## Advantages

1. **Generalization**:
   - Hyperplanes extend naturally to higher dimensions, making them versatile for [[High-Dimensional Data]].
2. **Mathematical Simplicity**:
   - Easy to compute and interpret in terms of geometry.
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Can be used for both [[Linear Models]] and kernel-based methods like [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]].

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Linear Assumption**:
   - Hyperplanes are inherently linear and may not capture complex relationships without transformations (e.g., kernels in [[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)]]).
2. **Interpretability in High Dimensions**:
   - Hard to visualize in dimensions higher than 3.
